This game has been worked on and touched by the hands of dozens, perhaps hundreds, of people throughout the years, not all of whom I have been fortunate enough to stay in contact with or know the contact info of, so while I will try to include the contact info I have (and get the approval for) for those that I know, many people will have been lost throughout the years--But please know that if you wish for your name to be added to this list, you can always contact Ashton/Anchorsify by e-mail at takun.masuko@gmail.com, or by Discord, @Anchorsify.  This page is meant to celebrate the collaboration that's happened throughout the years, and so if your name is missing, please don't hesitate to contact me and let me know you'd like to be added (and if you'd like your contact info placed in it, I'll do that, too).


First and foremost, without Miss Pink / Green Rabite, this game would not exist, no matter how hard anyone else worked on it, and to that end, Crais has created a website containing some of her (in)famous older quotes, which you can find [HERE](https://greenrabite.tmweb.dev/) and look through, if you'd like to enjoy some of her more memorable moments.  She left us far too soon, but so long as this game endures, I'd like to believe some part of her will continue to live on as well, from the enjoyment she enabled others to have playing Saiyans and Ninjas.

But in addition to Green Rabite's superb work on the game, it would not exist and thrive if not for the combined efforts of the following people who have helped to improve the game for others.  In alphabetical order, I want to personally thank:
