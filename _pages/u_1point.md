##### Alert
As far as ninja are concerned, real ninja, you are their worst nightmare. You can see beyond the unseen, making you a feared weapon. Your maximum Awareness rank is increased by 2, and you gain +3 to Espionage rolls. Your ranks in the Blind Fighting and Keen Senses abilities are considered 1 higher than the actual rank you have them at (even above the normal maximum), and the Scale on the Enhanced Hearing and Enhanced Sight abilities is reduced by 1. Finally, the Search action is Speed 3 for you.

##### Blur
It's hard to track you when you move, almost as if you can turn your own inertia on and off at will!  Your movement speed is increased by 10%, and Shunshin has no Chakra Exhaustion cost (though retains its normal Speed). Whenever you successfully dodge, you may move as many yards as if you'd taken a Speed 4 move action.

*Upgrades Into: Exceptionally Fast*

##### Close Ties
Your allies are incredibly important to you, each valued as much as a close friend. You form bonds fast, and they can last for life. Your mere presence raises morale! Your allies get a +3 bonus to Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion rolls. A single person can only benefit from one ally with Close Ties at a time.

So long as your allies are with you, you excel in the face of adversity. For every ally present with you in battle you gain a +1 bonus to your own Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion rolls, up to a maximum of +3.  Additionally, anytime an ally of yours spends a WP, you can choose to spend one of your WP in their place (which can be done even when an Ally spends a point of Willpower in a way that you yourself could not).

*Upgrades Into: Avenger, Protector*

##### Elementally Gifted
While most shinobi struggle to learn the basics of elemental control, you took to it like a fish to water (or a bird to wind, or... you know what, this joke is just bad). Your early aptitude is the first sign of a potential that'll leave even many experienced shinobi envious. You can use an element of your choice as if you had the Elemental Aptitude ability for it, without actually having to use one of your ranks of Elemental Aptitude, and you can apply the benefits of the ability Elemental Affinity to one additional element of your choice.

*Upgrades Into: Elementalist*

##### Expansive Chakra
Chakra flows readily through your body and into your jutsu, allowing you to effortlessly mold it into techniques. You gain a bonus to your Chakra Exhaustion rolls when using a Jutsu of 1 per rank (+1 for E, +2 for D, etc), up to +5 for A-rank techniques. Your ninjutsu damage bonus is increased by half that amount (0.5 for E-rank, 1 for D-rank, etc).  For Action Chains, this bonus is applied only once, and uses the base action's rank to determine its benefits.

*Upgrades Into: Boundless Chakra*

##### Full Pockets
You were born into money! Or you stole a lot of it, but through some means you happen to be a very rich and resourceful ninja. Be it tools, traps, or weapons, you are always ready for any situation. When you spend XP on Savings or Requisition, you get double the normal amount per rank. If you need to make an Espionage roll to bribe someone, it has a +5 bonus. What's more, you may spend Requisition spontaneously, even in the middle of a mission, representing you having just the right thing for the task at hand. Done in combat, this is a Speed 5 action.

##### Hidden Potential
You and your peers both have yet to realize the full extent of your capabilities. Maybe you just haven't found your niche, maybe you're a late bloomer, or maybe something's holding you back. Until you find out what it is, you have +1 Willpower, and calculate your Willpower as (STR + RES + CHA + DEX + AGI)/90, instead of normal.

*Upgrades Into: Any 2- or 3-point unique*

##### Indefatigable
(adj) 1. (of a person or their efforts) Persisting tirelessly

That's what you are! You have a bonus to Stamina rolls of 1, + 1 per rank of the jutsu being used (+2 for E-ranks, +3 for D-ranks, etc.); in the case of basic attacks, this becomes a +2 bonus. Additionally, when you Rest your Stamina penalty is lowered by one more.

*Upgrades Into: Endless Energy*

##### Killing Intent
You have what it takes to end a person's life. Even if you personally would choose not to, it's not because you lack the capacity. Something about you gives that away, that killer's instinct having seeped into your very chakra. Whenever you inflict a wound upon someone, you and your victim roll 1d20+XP/100.  You get +1 to your roll for every previous attack you've made which has wounded somone in the battle. If they fail, they receive a Stun with a severity of how much you beat their roll by, to a maximum of 15.

##### Lightfoot
You've always been talented at sneaking and hiding in almost any and all places. Whether a dark shadow or henge'd as a tissue box in a room, you know how make your presence scarce.  You have a +3 bonus to Stealth rolls, and the speed of your Hide action is reduced by 3. You can move when in Stealth 2 without lowering the level of your stealth.

*Upgrades Into: Skirmisher*

##### Martial Prowess
You're adept at turning a fight into a one-man training montage with your enemy being a rag doll disoriented by every blow. You have no need for weapons: You are the weapon. Your Combos are not broken when attacking a new target. You gain a +3 bonus to Counter Combo opposed rolls, and all your Combo jutsu have "Stun 1" added to their Combo Counter line. Additionally, your combos are not broken by a Stun of a severity less than (Combo Counter +2).

*Upgrades Into: Bruiser*

##### Quick Draw
You have always been able to pick things up, spin them between your fingers, throw things just right, and otherwise use your hands well. You may throw up to DEX/8 weapons with a multi-throw, reduce Seal Speeds and the Speed of ranged attacks by 2, and may draw weapons without any sort of action. You may sheathe weapons as a Speed 0 action.

*Upgrades Into: Fan of Knives, Single-Handed Seals*

##### Restrained
You know just how much force you're applying, and how to, when necessary, apply less. This is good when doing handiwork, but also when fighting someone who you don't want to kill or maim.

You gain all five ranks of the Holding Back ability for free, and when using the ability, your damage bonus is not decreased (though this does not affect your clones). You can elect to take up to a -2 to the Accuracy or Damage Bonus of any attack in which you use Holding Back with to then gain up to a +2 to the attack's Accuracy and/or Damage Bonus the next time you perform the same attack without holding back (the bonuses do not stack). Any time you inflict a wound upon someone, you can elect to reduce the wound's severity by one, though preventing a wound this way will not stop it from ending any Genjutsu the victim was suffering from.

When an attack you make would prove lethal, you may opt to hold back at the last moment. This leaves your victim at 0 HP (or, if they were below 0 HP, they aren't reduced any further), raises the severity of any wounds you inflicted by 1 (and cannot be combined with a normal activation of this unique), but prevents your attack from being fatal.
*Upgrades Into: Avenger, Protector*

##### Seal Master
You're really, really good with handseals. You make them fast, and mold your chakra just as rapidly. It could be natural talent... but, honestly, you know what it probably was? Probably when you were a kid you were incredibly obsessed with being a super-cool ninja, so you spent all your free time making fake handseals and pretending to shoot fireballs at your friends. You reduce all Seal Speeds by Dex/8 (instead of Dex/10), and for every 40 DEX over what is needed to reduce a jutsu's Seal Speed to 0 you have, you can choose to lower that technique's Speed by 1 (as if you'd spent AP to do so).

*Upgrades Into: Jutsu Master, Single-Handed Seals*

##### Weapon Master
You know your weapons. You know how to use them, and how to change them to suit your style. Your Weapon Focus ability applies to all weapons, only needing to be taken once, and it only increases Stamina costs by 2 per rank. Additionally, that ability's limit is changed to (DEX -20)/20, maximum 4. If you take this after creation, you may refund your extra Weapon Focus.

*Upgrades Into: Fan of Knives*

##### Weight Trainer
You strap yourself down with weights--either from tailoring your clothes that way, or from strapping weights to your limbs--and hamper yourself constantly. All in the name of one. Perfect. Fight.

Once per two months (in-character, so 8 days OOC) you can remove the weights as a Speed 10 action to increase all your stats by 18 for the remainder of the fight.  Your Vitality and HP current and maximums are unchanged by this, but other derived stats are.  Due to your hard training your maximum Athletics ranks are increased by 2.
