##### Elemental Mastery
You have peerless control over elemental chakra, far beyond the realm of what's considered normal, and to a level that some would even think is impossible. Choose two elements; you can use them as if you had taken the Elemental Aptitude ability for them. Additionally, your ranks in the Elemental Affinity ability apply to all elements you can use. This doesn't mean your personal chakra nature corresponds to all five elements, only that you're equally skilled with them all.

Additionally, you have an Elemental Shaping pool which dictates how much you can modify any given basic Elemental Ninjutsu (advanced elements can not be shaped), with one point in it for each element you have Aptitude for, and one point for each rank of each basic element you know a jutsu of (for a potential maximum of 30). You can use your Elemental Shaping pool to modify any Elemental Ninjutsu you perform in the following ways (which doesn’t ‘use up’ your pool; its size simply determines how much you can modify any given technique):

 - 15 points: +1 Target (for non-AoE jutsu)
 - 12 points: +1 Accuracy
 - 8 points: +1 Damage Bonus
 - 5 points: Add an effect from another element not its own: Stun 1 (Doton), Burns 1 (Katon), Shock 1 for 10 IC (Raiton), -1 Chakra Cost (Suiton), Knockback 1 yard (Fuuton)
 - 3 points: +1 Area
 - 2 points: +1 Range
 - 1 point: +1 Damage

There are some exceptions to the above: For jutsu which launch projectiles at targets (but not are not AoE, such as Houenka), additional targets gives a single extra projectile. Area and Range increases cannot add more than half the technique’s original Area or Range, and Range cannot modify a technique whose range is Touch. Similarly, any technique which does not list Area or Range cannot have them added to it to gain those qualities. The status effects added from Shaping (aside from Suiton’s, which is automatic) do not require a status roll, but do require you to hit with a damage-dealing ninjutsu attack, and accordingly do not apply to environmental effects (such as Hidden Mist, or Yomi Numa) though they can be added to techniques which already have them, so long as they’re a valid choice.  In the case of Raiton's Shock status, every 5 points past the first five can increase the Shock by one, or increase its duration by 10 IC.

You can pick any of the options multiple times, limited only by the size of your Shaping pool.  Shaping does not ‘combine elements’ in any sort of way (overt or otherwise), but rather modifies one element based off of properties of another: A Suiton that burns might be described as pressurized to tear away at the skin on contact, while a Raiton that knocks back a target might actually seem to crackle through the air and strike from below to lift someone off their feet as it hits. Just take care not to describe a knockback Suiton as Hyouton, for example, or a Fuuton that burns as Scorch release: advanced elements are a true combination of two different chakra nature types, while Shaping is modifying the base element in the style of another.

##### Regenerative Chakra
You have a seemingly inexhaustible supply of chakra. You might push yourself to your limit, but within minutes your chakra reserves will have replenished themselves. During combat in particular, it's noticeable that your energy seems to have no limit.

You have a +5 bonus to Chakra Exhaustion rolls, and every 10 IC, your CE penalty is reduced by 1. When using one or more techniques with an Upkeep, the total Upkeep is reduced by 1+CHA/30. Additionally, once per battle you may fail a Chakra Exhaustion roll and advance one less Fatigue level (though your penalties do not reset).  As you are worn down progressively, your body tries to compensate by producing even more chakra, increasing your ninjutsu damage bonus by your Fatigue level.

You have your maximum Willpower in 'Chakra Points' each battle, which can be spent to improve the result of a Chakra Exhaustion roll after seeing the result, adding your current fatigue level + 1 to the result for each Chakra Point spent (Fatigue 0 = +1, Fatigue 1 = +2, etc). Alternatively, you can spend a Chakra Point in place of the normal cost for creating a Kage Bunshin, although if you do so, you do not get any spent Chakra Points back by unsummoning the clones voluntarily.

##### Relentless
You don't stop, you don't quit, and you absolutely don't give up. Those would be great, admirable traits, except for you it only really applies when it comes to brutalizing other human beings.

Every time you hit someone with a damaging attack (grapple jutsu which automatically hit do not count for this), you get a +2 bonus to your damage bonus, up to a maximum of half its normal value (not counting temporary or situational modifiers such as Chakra Strengthening or Skirmisher). This bonus resets when you miss with a damaging attack.

When you miss with any damaging attack your next action comes sooner, as if the Speed of the action you used was half its actual value. For example, if you missed with a Speed 13 action on IC 30, your next action would come on IC 37, rather than IC 43. Every time you miss, your next attack gets a cumulative +1 Accuracy, to a maximum of +5; hitting someone resets this bonus.

##### Super Novice
You're still not good at anything in particular. Everything for you is two steps forwards and one step back. Even if you thought you found your niche, it turns out that no, you really didn't. But you're tired of letting that get in your way! Now, you're going to just do what you want, your way! Yeah! That'll show 'em!

You have a 10% XP bonus. When you're Wounded, you get a temporary 1 point of Willpower. This lasts until the next time you're Wounded; if you haven't spent it by then, it's replaced. If you have, you get a new one.

*Upgrades From: Any 1- or 2-point unique, except Elementally Gifted or Elementalist*

##### Surging Power
You have a dauntless ability to keep fighting, no matter what the situation. Even when you should be sprawled in the dirt unable to move a single muscle, somehow you stand back up and keep fighting.

Whenever you spend a point of Willpower, you halve your current penalty to Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion rolls.  Alternatively, you can choose to spend a point of Willpower in order to remove your current penalties to Stamina or Chakra exhaustion rolls. Additionally, you can spend a point of Willpower to ignore all effects of a single wound you're suffering from for the remainder of the battle.

Finally, you reduce the penalties to Accuracy and Defensive rolls from fatigue by half your maximum willpower, rounded down. So, at 3 Fatigue with 7 maximum Willpower from your attributes, you would go from -3 Accuracy and -6 defensive rolls to no Accuracy penalty and -3 Defensive rolls.

*Upgrades From: Boundless Chakra, Endless Energy*

##### Tactician
Beyond raw strength or the biggest fireballs, you focus on a different aspect of combat: strategy. Through clever decoys, exploiting weaknesses, and striking at blindspots, you can take down superior foes.

The first time you use any specific action in a given battle, that action gains +2 Accuracy or to its relevant d20 roll (such as a dodge). If you hit with an attack that receives that bonus, you immediately gain (that action's Speed)/2 AP (though this won't take you over your maximum).

You may spend 10 AP to replace an action's Accuracy (or convert its existing accuracy roll) into an accuracy roll using 2d20kh1 (roll two dice, keep the higher one) in place of 1d20. You can shout advice or instructions, or just pointers about your enemies and the battlefield, to allies, to give them an edge: as a Speed 0 action, you can switch your current place in the initiative order with a willing ally's, allowing them to act immediately and delaying your next action to the previous location of theirs. This costs 2 AP per IC away their action is, and may not be used on a stunned ally.

You may spend 1 Willpower to lower the cost to 1 AP per IC for one use.
