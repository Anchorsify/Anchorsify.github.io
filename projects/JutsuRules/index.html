These use chakra, either projected outwards or used to amplify one’s physical performance, to perform feats that would be literally impossible for a normal person. These are divided into three broad categories: taijutsu, ninjutsu, and genjutsu.</p> <p>Taijutsu, or body techniques, use the chakra flowing throughout a ninja’s body to give them the exceptional speed or strength needed to perform the techniques. They are mostly physical attacks. This includes both unarmed combat, and weapon techniques.</p> <p>Ninjutsu, or ninja techniques, use chakra to accomplish what those unfamiliar with them might call magic. These effects range from changing one’s appearance to projecting balls of flame, to summoning water from thin air, to healing grievous injuries.</p> <p>Genjutsu, or illusion techniques, use chakra to either construct illusions in the environment or to directly affect an enemy’s mind and confuse their senses. Of the three, they are the most difficult to learn.</p> <h2 id="rules">Rules</h2> <p>Each jutsu is a unique action that, once you’ve learned it, you can perform. All jutsu are divided into five main ranks (E, D, C, B, and A), with S-rank techniques being rare techniques known only to their inventor and perhaps a handful of people that person taught them to. Though each rank of each type has special requirements to learn (explained in more detail in the relevant sections), a few broad rules apply. For example, to learn ninjutsu of one of the five elements, you need the appropriate Elemental Aptitude ability.</p> <h4 id="readers-guide">Reader’s Guide</h4> <p>Most of the jutsu entries have a lot of information packed into them. To help make them easier to read, a lot of the common factors are written using shorthand; for example, rather than spelling out “Using this technique requires you to make a Chakra Exhaustion roll against 10”, a jutsu would have an entry of “Chakra: 10”. Below are all the common terms you’ll see in jutsu entries, and what they mean.</p> <h6 id="stamina--chakra">Stamina / Chakra</h6> <p>The technique’s Stamina and Chakra cost, respectively.</p> <h6 id="upkeep">Upkeep</h6> <p>Upkeeps apply a penalty to all Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion rolls while maintained in exchange for maintaining an effect indefinitely (such as doujutsu, ninjutsu-created weapons, or Chakra Flow).</p> <h6 id="damage">Damage</h6> <p>The base damage dealt by the technique. You add your damage bonus (multiplied by the attack’s modified Speed) to this number. Unless otherwise specified, Taijutsu use your Physical Damage Bonus, and Ninjutsu use your Ninjutsu Damage Bonus.</p> <h6 id="accuracy">Accuracy</h6> <p>Some jutsu have bonuses or penalties to accuracy. If there’s no entry for this, it uses your normal accuracy.</p> <h6 id="range">Range</h6> <p>How many yards away the attack’s target can be. In the case of area-of-effect techniques, they can be centered anywhere within this range (and their effects may well extend beyond it). There’s one special effect associated with Range: If a Jutsu (of any type) has a Range of “Touch”, then you use your Taijutsu Accuracy with it, even if it is a Ninjutsu or Genjutsu, and it is possible to defend against it with an unarmed parry.</p> <h6 id="area">Area</h6> <p>The radius, in yards, of area-of-effect techniques. Some may not use simple circular areas, in which case more details will be provided in the description itself.</p> <h6 id="speed">Speed</h6> <p>The jutsu’s base Speed. As a reminder: No action can have its Speed reduced by more than half, rounded up, and attacks may not have their Speed reduced below 3.</p> <h6 id="seal-speed">Seal Speed</h6> <p>The jutsu’s base seal speed.</p> <h6 id="special">Special</h6> <p>Any special effects the technique has. If a status effect is listed here, it’s inflicted automatically.</p> <h6 id="requires">Requires</h6> <p>Some techniques have special requirements (such as having learned another jutsu, or a certain amount of gallons of water be available for use), which will be listed here.</p> <h6 id="effects">Effects</h6> <p>Any special characteristics of a technique which aren’t covered by one of the above categories are listed here.</p> <h2 id="taijutsu">Taijutsu</h2> <p>Taijutsu is more than just hand-to-hand combat; these techniques go well beyond the realm of what’s possible for normal humans, smashing rocks and the like. It’s not exactly… easy. There are three ways to qualify to learn a taijutsu technique: the first is your rank in the Athletics skill. If you’re in good enough physical condition, you can pull off some pretty impressive things. The second, Research skill rank, sufficient understanding of how the move should be executed allows you to make up for your shortcomings.</p> <p>Finally, rank: If you’re high-enough ranking, you’re able to pull enough strings and ask for enough favors to get someone to spare the time to tediously instruct you in how to perform a technique, making up for your own shortcomings. Each rank has its own requirements, an each method meets them differently.</p> <h5 id="rank">Rank:</h5> <ul> <li>E: Genin</li> <li>C: Chuunin, Special Jounin</li> <li>B: Jounin</li> </ul> <h5 id="athletics">Athletics:</h5> <ul> <li>D: 4</li> <li>C: 10</li> <li>B: 20</li> <li>A: 30</li> </ul> <h5 id="research">Research:</h5> <ul> <li>D: 7</li> <li>C: 13</li> <li>B: 23</li> <li>A: 33</li> </ul> <p>Finally, unarmed and combo jutsu require <strong>TWO</strong> free hands to use (though you can perform basic unarmed attacks with your legs and thus, even when one or both hands aren’t free). Grapples only require one, and weapons depend on the weapon used.</p> <h4 id="weapon-jutsu">Weapon Jutsu</h4> <p>Weapon jutsu are special techniques which can be performed only while using a specific sort of weapon. All weapon jutsu will have a “Type” entry, where they’ll listen a certain characteristic, such as Slashing or Sword. Only a weapon which meets these requirements may be used with that technique. Many of these jutsu will list “As Weapon” in one or more of their entries. For example, if you are using a Stamina 12 weapon, and the technique lists “Stamina: As Weapon +3”, the Stamina cost to use it would be 15. If a weapon has a Delay, then any techniques using it also inherit this Delay. For example, using Oak Flight (a technique which normally has no Delay) with a Tetsubo would cause your attack to have Delay 6 (the Tetsubo’s normal Delay). If a technique has a Delay of, for example, “As Weapon +3”, weapons without a Delay are treated as having a natural Delay 0 (meaning, in that case, the technique would have Delay 3).</p> <h4 id="combos">Combos</h4> <p>Combos are a special type of unarmed taijutsu attack which benefit from being used in rapid succession. There are three types of taijutsu attacks related to combos: Openers, Combos, and Finishers.</p> <h6 id="power-attack-and-unarmed-focus">Power Attack and Unarmed Focus</h6> <p>When a combo jutsu specified Base Attack Damage, this means basic uarmed attack damage, which can benifit from both Power Attack and Unarmed Focus. Any time a jutsu says ‘d<em>’, this is an improvement to the base damage, and likewise benefits from Power Attack. Power Attack does not apply to any dice that have a size listed (d6, d8, d12, etc), only d</em>.</p> <h6 id="openers">Openers</h6> <p>Openers are not, themselves, combo moves. Using a jutsu as an Opener (rather than as a Strike or Finisher, if applicable) immediately sets your Combo Counter to 0 (raising it to 1 if it hits as usual). However, after an opener hits, you may launch into a combo (i.e. use a Combo jutsu). Openers are marked as such in their entry, usually by “Special: Opener.”</p> <h6 id="combos-1">Combos</h6> <p>Combo moves indicate as much in their name (typically being named “___ Combo”), or by being in the Taijutsu Combo category. You cannot use a combo jutsu unless the last non-Interrupt action you took was a Combo or Opener; similarly, if your combo is broken (see below), you have to start with a new opener. When you begin a combo, you have a “Combo Counter”– basically, the number of combo moves you’ve strung together. This starts at 1 when you hit with an opener. Each time you hit with a combo, the combo counter increases by 1.</p> <p>Each combo will have a combo counter entry; for example, here is Lotus Combo’s: Combo Counter: +1 Accuracy, +2d10 damage, +1 Stun, +2 Stamina</p> <p>This works as might be expected: You multiply those bonuses by the number of combo counters you’ve amassed. Thus, if you opened with a Kage Buyou and proceeded to a Lotus Combo, the first hit would have +1 Accuracy, +2d10 damage, and +1 Stun (because you’re at Combo 1 after the opener); if it hit you’d progress up to Combo 2, and the next combo you used would have +2 Accuracy, +4d10 damage, +2 Stun, and +2 Stamina cost.</p> <p>Some combos or finishers have notation like +3dX. These are based on basic unarmed damage to some degree, and the X in these cases will always refer to the die size of your basic unarmed attacks, based on how much Power Attack you’re using on that combo component, so with all four ranks of Power Attack, for instance, it would be adding d12s.</p> <h6 id="switching-combos">Switching Combos</h6> <p>Once you’ve begun a combo, any other combo jutsu is fair game. You could freely alternate between Lion and Lotus combos as you pleased. For the most part, things remain simple. Each move increases your Combo Counter normally, no matter how many times you switch between combo moves. Your Combo Counter bonuses are based only on the move you’re currently using. For example, say you used Kage Buyou as an opener, then 4 Lotus Combos, followed by 3 Lion Combos. This would give you a total Combo of 8 hits (1 + 4 + 3). If your next Combo move was a Lion combo, you’d multiply its CC bonuses (+1 Accuracy and -1 Speed) by 8, giving you a total of +8 Accuracy and -8 Speed (though this would put it at only Speed 5, because it still can’t be reduced below half its base Speed).</p> <h6 id="finishers">Finishers</h6> <p>The final type of move is finishers. Finishers may be used on their own, but have a special effect if used at the end of a combo. Though they do not receive the stacking effects for consecutive combo hits, they have special effects based on your total combo counters. For example, the Lion Barrage finisher has the following entry: Combo Bonus: +2d10 damage For each combo counter you have when you execute Lion Barrage, its damage is increased by 2d10.</p> <h6 id="combo-breaking">Combo Breaking</h6> <p>When a combo is broken, your combo counter is immediately set to 0, you may not continue using combo moves, and all accrued combo counter bonuses are lost. Combo breaking occurs if any of the following things happen:</p> <ul> <li>You use any non-combo jutsu (even if it’s an interrupt).</li> <li>You take a non-combo, non-interrupt action.</li> <li>You execute a finisher.</li> <li>You attack a new target.</li> <li>You are Stunned.</li> </ul> <h2 id="ninjutsu">Ninjutsu</h2> <p>Learning ninjutsu is a great deal of work; a ninja has to learn how to mold their chakra, how to convert it to the right elemental nature, then how to properly project it, along with memorizing all the necessary handseals… for each individual jutsu they know.</p> <p>There are three ways you can qualify to learn ninjutsu of a given rank. The first is Chakra Control skill ranks: With sufficient control over your chakra it becomes easier to mold it efficiently, and mold the vast amounts of chakra used in higher-end techniques with the appropriate precision. Next is Research skill ranks. You can make up for poor chakra control by knowing how chakra behaves even when you can’t control it, and understanding what the technique is trying to accomplish. Finally, character rank. Once you have enough pull in your village, you can bother the right people to teach you how to use techniques without getting brushed off for wasting their time.</p> <p>You only need to meet one of those requirements for a given jutsu rank to learn those jutsu. They are listed… below.</p> <h5 id="rank-1">Rank:</h5> <ul> <li>E: Genin</li> <li>C: Chuunin, Special Jounin</li> <li>B: Jounin</li> </ul> <h5 id="chakra-control">Chakra Control:</h5> <ul> <li>D: 4</li> <li>C: 10</li> <li>B: 20</li> <li>A: 30</li> </ul> <h5 id="research-1">Research:</h5> <ul> <li>D: 7</li> <li>C: 13</li> <li>B: 23</li> <li>A: 33</li> </ul> <h4 id="special-rules">Special Rules</h4> <h6 id="advanced-elements">Advanced Elements</h6> <p>Advanced Elements are found as kekkai genkai in various clans: Senju’s Mokuton is an advanced element combining Doton and Suiton together, for example. Advanced Elements have their own effects listed in the relevant clan entries that utilize them, including elemental strengths and weaknesses. Unlike the base five elements (which follow a nice little circle of a strength and a corresponding weakness found together), Advanced Elements operate outside of said circle: Mokuton being weak to Raiton does not make Raiton correspondingly Strong against it, just as Mokuton being strong against Doton and Katon does not make Doton or Katon weak to Mokuton.</p> <p>When converting a technique which specifies any sort of elemental-based strength or weakness, replace (base element’s weakness) with (advanced element’s weakness), and do the same for strengths. For example, Earth Shore Return normally reads, in its last sentence: This wall takes double damage from Raiton, and half damage from Suiton. If you converted that technique to Jiton, it would behave as if it instead said: This wall takes double damage from Fuuton, and half damage from Doton and Katon.</p> <p>When something is not covered by strengths and weaknesses, consider all mentions of (component element) to instead say (composite element).</p> <p>Finally, in the case of Action Chains using an advanced element, the Chakra cost for converting the base technique(s) to that element needs only be paid once, and all eligible links in the chain are converted. For example, if you created an action chain out of Jiton Shuurai and Jiton Tremor, the Chakra cost would be 26 (15 + 6 + 5, for Shuurai, Tremor, and the conversion to Jiton).</p> <h6 id="earth-doton">Earth (Doton)</h6> <p>In the rare situation that there is no earth available (such as on a boat), these jutsu are pretty useless. A few may remain usable (if, for example, they involve you regurgitating huge amounts of mud, instead of manipulating the environment), but most will not.</p> <h6 id="fire-katon">Fire (Katon)</h6> <p>If you ever find yourself completely submerged in water, Katon jutsu won’t work.</p> <h6 id="lightning-raiton">Lightning (Raiton)</h6> <p>Nothing out of the ordinary here! This is chakra-based electricity, not real electricity, so it has no special ability to, say, electrocute everyone in contact with water, or anything like that.</p> <h6 id="water-suiton">Water (Suiton)</h6> <p>Water is at a disadvantage among elemental jutsu in that it requires raw material to use (earth techniques do as well, but it’s rare to find oneself in a situation without ground). Accordingly, most water jutsu require some amount of ‘gallons of water’ to be performed, listed as a Requirement. This water has to come from somewhere. Unless the fight is taking place is near a river (a small stream won’t cut it) or a lake, or, say, on a boat, it’s not going to be from the environment. There are two ways to bring water into a battle where there otherwise is none: the first is to physically carry it, typically in a gourd (see the Equipment chapter). The other is the E-Rank Water Creation Technique. Some Suiton add water to the battlefield, while others remove it, so be sure to keep track of how much water is on the battlefield if you plan to make use of Suiton! You can’t use water someone else is carrying into battle, but water in the environment is fair game. Any Suiton with an Upkeep (such as Water-Cutting Blade) has its gallons of water effectively removed from the battlefield so long as the upkeep is maintained: those gallons of water can’t be accessed or manipulated by anyone until the person maintaining the Upkeep stops doing so.</p> <h6 id="wind-fuuton">Wind (Fuuton)</h6> <p>Blocking reduces the damage of Wind techniques by only 25%. A rare form of combat is using a fan to perform fuuton jutsu. It’s not without its advantages: using the fan you can rapidly manipulate wind and infuse it with chakra, removing the seal speed from the technique you’re using. However, doing this can be tiring, as it replaces the normal Chakra cost with a Stamina cost, +2 per Rank of the jutsu (E = +2, D = +4, etc).</p> <h4 id="medical-ninjutsu">Medical Ninjutsu</h4> <p>One of the few good things the development of ways to control chakra has brought to the world is the appropriately named medical ninjutsu. These are techniques which safely transfer chakra to another person, or use it to accelerate the natural healing process, cure maladies, and otherwise ameliorate suffering and avoid unnecessary casualties. Medical ninjutsu also has a darker side. The pioneers in the field learned the secrets of the human body so that they could help people, but more than a handful of infamous missing ninja of the past have found ways to weaponize it, or worse. Unless otherwise specified in their descriptions, you may not use any medical jutsu on yourself. If any Medical Ninjutsu technique has a listed Upkeep, that Upkeep is paid by the recipient of the technique, rather than the medic; this represents the medic adjusting the flows of that person’s chakra to preserve their health. This does mean that those techniques can be voluntarily (or forcibly) ended, though the “Dazed” Wound will specifically not do so. You must meet all listed requirements to learn medical ninjutsu of a given rank, and in order to learn any Medical Ninjutsu, you must first have the Talent: Medical Training.</p> <ul> <li>D: 5 Chakra Control, 5 Medicine</li> <li>C: 10 Chakra Control, 15 Medicine</li> <li>B: 20 Chakra Control, 25 Medicine</li> <li>A: 30 Chakra Control, 35 Medicine</li> </ul> <h4 id="fuuinjutsu">Fuuinjutsu</h4> <p>Fuuinjutsu, or sealing techniques, are, as the name suggests, techniques which use chakra to form specialized ‘seals’. They’re difficult to use, and have limited combat viability. What makes them useful is that these seals are stable. Normally, any sort of chakra-based effect will expire soon after its user stops applying chakra to it, the energy dissipating back into the world. Seals don’t, and depending on the individual seal and the skill of the user some can last for decades if left undisturbed. The downside is, they’re counterintuitive and complicated. To learn fuuinjutsu, you have to meet all the requirements listed for a given rank, and in order to learn any Fuuinjutsu, you must first have the Talent: Seal Training.</p> <ul> <li>D: 5 Chakra Control, 5 Research</li> <li>C: 10 Chakra Control, 15 Research</li> <li>B: 20 Chakra Control, 25 Research</li> <li>A: 30 Chakra Control, 35 Research</li> </ul> <p>Many sealing techniques have “Range: Touch”, and accordingly, must touch someone to take effect. As a reminder, Jutsu which have such ranges use the user’s Taijutsu Accuracy and, accordingly, can be parried as if they were an unarmed attack. Unique to Sealing techniques is that, by default, opponents hit by them have no cause to suspect anything is amiss: When you hit someone with one such seal, make an opposed Espionage roll, with you gaining +10 to your roll. If you succeed, your opponent has no cause to suspect anything is amiss or that you did anything more than tap them until the seal’s effects themselves take place. Even if you fail this roll, the target can’t immediately identify which seal was placed upon them unless they can see chakra and are themselves trained to use Fuuinjutsu; someone who can see Chakra simply knows a seal has been applied, but not what it is, and some seals are undetectable even by Doujutsu, listed in their individual entries.</p> <p>Several seals have long-term effects which last until the seal itself is removed (potentially lasting long past the user’s own death), and as such, there are a limited amount of Seals any Fuuinjutsu user can maintain at one time: You can only maintain up to your maximum Willpower in Seals which indicate they are “Exclusive” at one time. Using another Exclusive seal when you are already at your limit for Exclusive Seals causes your oldest most Exclusive Seal to fade harmlessly automatically. You can undo your own Exclusive seals by touching the person (or object) the seal is placed upon and concentrating to undo the seal, a Speed 5 action in combat with no associated cost.</p> <h4 id="created-weapons-enhanced-attacks-and-you">Created weapons, enhanced attacks and you!</h4> <p>Weapons and ninjutsu that empower taijutsu have a few special effects. First, when created they count as ninjutsu (for cases of chakra rolls and the like), however, when attacking they count as taijutsu. This means they do not gain the bonuses from things such as specialist which empower ninjutsu, but would gain it from taijutsu. They do count as their element when opposing different elements, however, which applies to advanced elements effects as well. Created weapons only count for their element against elemental defenses; they do not gain any of the other benefits of being dual-element.</p> <p>Additionally, elemental weapons may only have chakra flow of their element used on them (for example, a water sword could not have a wind chakra flow). This does mean a dual-element weapon can use either elemental flow (an ice water sword could use wind or water chakra flow). This does not apply to jutsu such as Lightning Blade, which is merely a burst of an element, rather than infusing the element long-term.</p> <p>For jutsu such as Four Seasonal Wind Palm, which enhance taijutsu, this can cause them to lose the benefits of the jutsu (such as enhanced blocking penetration), unless the element they turned it into had a similar benefit of the same type (for example, Ice retains the 25% block reduction, while Scorch would outright ignore blocking; on the other hand, Magnetism would offer no block reduction at all, as block reduction is not an inherent trait of Jiton ninjutsu).</p> <h4 id="bunshin">Bunshin</h4> <p>Bunshin, unless stated otherwise, act on the IC they were created. If they were created before the initiative, then they act on their user’s IC. Clones can ONLY perform actions listed in their action options (which means only wood, bug and shadow bunshin could perform actions such as Meditation), though you can spend AP to reduce their speeds. Bunshin act on their own IC, separate from their creator, and using them does not increase the user’s speed unless explicitly mentioned. As they are separate entities, they do NOT benefit from any jutsu you use that designates you, such as Kage Buyou. They would also count as individual entities for jutsu that can target/avoid a set number of targets. Any bunshin that can take actions (such as through the use of AP, or being independent) can talk. Bunshin that can not take actions cannot.</p> <p>All Bunshin can make basic dodges and parries without you having to pay AP for them to defend themselves, but anything beyond either of those two actions incurs their normal costs (both with appropriate Fatigue rolls and appropriate AP costs depending on the Speed and the type of Bunshin used). Bunshin do not generate AP on their own or from other effects that would ordinarily generate AP (such as opening Gates), and can not have WP spent for their actions. Similarly, effects based upon consecutive actions (such as Tsuga, or Jyuuken, or Relentless) are tracked separately for each bunshin, and you do not gain any bonuses (or penalties) associated with their actions.</p> <p>All Bunshin are created as a Fatigue 1 version of you, with all the normal benefits and penalties that implies. Bunshin which specify they have their own Fatigue and pay their own costs accordingly can take on their own Upkeeps, otherwise, you pay all their Fatigue costs (all Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion rolls they make, or are forced to make), and take on any Upkeeps from actions they perform. Should a Bunshin that can make their own Fatigue rolls fail a Stamina or Chakra Exhaustion check badly enough that it would bring them one or more levels of fatigue beyond the point at which it would normally destroy itself, the technique fails outright in addition to the clone destroying itself. This is effectively just an extension of the normal rules of what happens when someone knocks themselves too far unconscious from the costs of one technique (see the Fatigue section of the Combat chapter).</p> <p>All attacks made by Bunshin are considered to be Held Back at its maximum rank, as per the ability in Chapter 5, even if you do not have the Hold Back ability. This means they use only half your damage bonus for dealing damage, and the severity of wounds they inflict is reduced by one category. If for some reason you acquire an “S-Rank” jutsu which a Bunshin performs (Naruto..), it, too, is still Held Back.</p> <h2 id="genjutsu">Genjutsu</h2> <p>Genjutsu’s not easy. In fact, genjutsu is really, really hard, even by the standards of other ninja techniques. Taijutsu and ninjutsu are both, after enough shinobi training, slightly intuitive; and, in the case of the latter, every ninja has an elemental affinity they can rely on to help them out even when they struggle overall. Not so with genjutsu. There is no such thing as an ‘affinity’ for it (though some ninja who seem to have an easier time learning it are occasionally described as such), and it takes a lot work to be able to use it effectively. The requirements for using Genjutsu of a given rank are listed below.</p> <ul> <li>E: Genjutsu Training ability</li> <li>D: 5 Chakra Control, 5 Research, and 12 (Chakra Control + Research)</li> <li>C: 10 Chakra Control, 10 Research, and 25 (Chakra Control + Research)</li> <li>B: 20 Chakra Control, 20 Research, and 48 (Chakra Control + Research)</li> <li>A: 30 Chakra Control, 30 Research, and 70 (Chakra Control + Research)</li> </ul> </d-article> <d-appendix> <d-footnote-list></d-footnote-list> <d-citation-list></d-citation-list> </d-appendix> <d-bibliography src="/assets/bibliography/"></d-bibliography> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 Anchorsify .
