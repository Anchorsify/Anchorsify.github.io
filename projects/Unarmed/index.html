Calling it a ‘technique’ is misleading, but there’s more to unbalancing a ninja than just wanting to; it does take at least a little bit of training.</p> <ul> <li>Stamina: 8</li> <li>Accuracy: +2</li> <li>Speed: 4</li> </ul> <p>Effects: If this hits, the target makes an Athletics roll against your Accuracy; if they fail the Athletics roll, they’re knocked prone. While prone, you take a -3 to Accuracy, -2 to defensive rolls, and you move at half speed until standing up as a Speed 5 action. Targets gain a +3 to their Athletics roll for every time in the same combat they’ve had to make such a roll to avoid being tripped.</p> <h4 id="-feint-">–( Feint )–</h4> <p>A subtle trick that almost every ninja knows–and knows how to detect. Still, those that are particularly adept at it are often difficult to defend against properly.</p> <ul> <li>Stamina: +2</li> <li>Speed: +2</li> </ul> <p>Effect: This is used alongside any other melee-range unarmed attack. Make an opposed Espionage roll; if you beat their result, you’ve tricked them with your feint. If successful, this doubles the Speed of their defensive action for the purpose of determining when they’ll act next (after all other modifications). This doesn’t prevent it from being a valid Interrupt against your attack.</p> <h2 id="d-rank">D-Rank</h2> <h4 id="-teiryuu-dageki---halting-blow-">–( Teiryuu Dageki - Halting Blow )–</h4> <p>In one smooth motion, the user extends their arm and pushed aside an oncoming blow, steps inward and pulls back their forearm to slam their elbow into the opponent, turning their defense into their offense.</p> <ul> <li>Stamina: 10</li> <li>Damage: (STR/10)d4</li> <li>Speed: 5</li> <li>Special: Interrupt</li> </ul> <p>Effects: You make an unarmed parry against a melee attack, with a +3 Accuracy bonus. If you successfully defend, then this becomes an attack which uses the result of your parry roll as its Accuracy. Any links you wish to add to the attack portion of this technique must be added at the time you use it as a defense, and follow normal limitations for interrupts. Similarly, you pay the cost even if you don’t successfully defend.</p> <h4 id="-senpuu---whirlwind-">–( Senpuu - Whirlwind )–</h4> <p>The user rotates while extending one leg, starting with a high roundhouse that’s used partially as a feint. Whether it hits or misses, they continue to rotate into a second spin aimed at the lower part of the body.</p> <ul> <li>Stamina: 13</li> <li>Damage: (STR/10)d10</li> <li>Area: 2</li> <li>Speed: 12</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This attack hits all enemies in range. If partial defense applies, this deals 25% damage per point you hit by, rather than 20%.</p> <h4 id="-houshou---crushing-fist-">–( Houshou - Crushing Fist )–</h4> <p>Usually considering a rude thing to do to someone, the user slams their fist into their opponent’s stomach at an upward angle, knocking the air from their lungs if done properly.</p> <ul> <li>Stamina: 10</li> <li>Damage: (STR/10)d8</li> <li>Speed: 14</li> </ul> <p>Effects: If it hits, the target’s Stamina penalty is increased by 2, +1 per severity of wound it inflicts (3 at Minor, 4 at Major, and so forth).</p> <h4 id="-reppuu---gale-">–( Reppuu - Gale )–</h4> <p>With alarming quickness you drop low to the ground and perform a full 360-degree sweeping kick that knocks opponents off their feet when they attempt to close in for an attack of their own.</p> <ul> <li>Stamina: 10</li> <li>Damage: (STR/10)d6</li> <li>Speed: 6</li> <li>Special: Interrupt, Opener</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This may be used immediately after you have successfully dodged a melee-range attack. Reppuu is an attack against whoever’s action you dodged, and uses your dodge roll as its Accuracy. Alternately, you may use Reppuu as a normal attack, using your regular Accuracy (rather than a dodge roll). When used as an Interrupt following a dodge, Reppuu can not have Links added onto it, but as its own attack, Reppuu can have links applied as normal.</p> <p>When used as an opener to a combo, any time a non-interrupt combo attack fails to hit your opponent you may choose to perform it again as an interrupt. If this missed attack is a finisher, you may perform the finisher again as an interrupt using the CC of the first, despite the fact that your combo has been broken.</p> <h4 id="-dainamikku-entorii---dynamic-entry-">–( Dainamikku Entorii - Dynamic Entry )–</h4> <p>This technique is nothing more than a jumpkick at an opponent from hiding. The hiding part became required because of genin’s tendency to shout out things like “HIYAH!” as they did it.</p> <ul> <li>Stamina: 15</li> <li>Damage: (STR/6)d10</li> <li>Speed: 10</li> <li>Requires: You must be hidden from your target.</li> </ul> <p>Effects: After the first time Dynamic Entry has been used in combat (by you, by someone else, it doesn’t matter) it has a -6 Accuracy for the rest of that battle.</p> <h4 id="-shoushitsu---rising-knee-">–( Shoushitsu - Rising Knee )–</h4> <p>The user gets in close and slams their knee into the midsection of their opponent. While not complex, the pain experienced is enough to make them double over, leaving them vulnerable for a few seconds.</p> <ul> <li>Stamina: 15</li> <li>Damage: (STR/8)d10</li> <li>Speed: 12</li> <li>Special: Stun 5</li> </ul> <h4 id="-tokken---thrusting-shoulder-">–( Tokken - Thrusting Shoulder )–</h4> <p>By charging forward and turning at the last moment to bring a shoulder out front, the user slams into the enemy, knocking them back. It relies mostly on the weight of the user, with the expectation they’ll be heavier than the person they’re running into.</p> <ul> <li>Stamina: 12</li> <li>Damage: (RES/10)d8</li> <li>Speed: 12</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This knocks the victim back (your RES)/15 yards.</p> <h2 id="c-rank">C-Rank</h2> <h4 id="-daisenpuu---great-whirlwind-">–( Daisenpuu - Great Whirlwind )–</h4> <p>A more complex version of Senpuu which involves three kicks to the target’s body going in the reverse order as before, starting low and going high to end with an axekick to the opponent’s head. The speed and constant rotation is strong enough to actually lift the practitioner into the air during execution.</p> <ul> <li>Stamina: 18</li> <li>Damage: (STR/8)d12</li> <li>Area: 3</li> <li>Speed: 14</li> <li>Requires: Senpuu</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This attack hits all enemies in range. If partial defense applies, you deal 1/3 damage per point you hit by, rather than 20%.</p> <h4 id="-tsutenkyaku---painful-sky-leg-">–( Tsutenkyaku - Painful Sky Leg )–</h4> <p>After concentrating chakra in the user’s legs, they leap high into the air and come down in a destructive axe kick, using gravity to enhance the momentum behind the blow while the user’s chakra is used to enhance the destructive force of the blow.</p> <ul> <li>Stamina: 24</li> <li>Damage: (STR/8)d12</li> <li>Accuracy: -6</li> <li>Area: 3 + PDB</li> <li>Speed: 20</li> </ul> <p>Effects: Partial success does not apply to the actual target of this attack. Whether or not this technique hits or is successfully defended against, the target (and everyone else in its area) might still be hit by the shockwave of exploding earth all around them from the impact with the ground, which deals no base damage of its own, but applies this technique’s (Speed * PDB) damage to anyone caught in the area, losing 10% of its damage per point it missed by (so missing by 2 has it deal (Speed * PDB * 0.8), for example). Successfully parrying the attack does not prevent the shockwave damage, though if someone is airborne, they can avoid this secondary damage (which is typically only applicable against flying puppets or a target knocked airborne by Kage Buyou). Most notably, this does mean that the intended target of this technique, if hit, takes full damage from the shockwave, in addition to the attack’s full damage, as a single damage source (defenses and damage reduction applies only once to the combined damage, not separately against the hit and the shockwave).</p> <h4 id="-kage-buyou---shadow-of-the-dancing-leaf-">–( Kage Buyou - Shadow of the Dancing Leaf )–</h4> <p>The user lowers themselves to get underneath their opponent, and then knocks them into the air with a violent rising kick, leaping after them immediately after it to position themselves in the target’s shadow.</p> <ul> <li>Stamina: 15</li> <li>Damage: (STR/8)d6</li> <li>Accuracy: +2</li> <li>Speed: 6</li> <li>Special: Opener</li> </ul> <p>Effects: If Kage Buyo hits, your opponent is considered to be knocked airborne until their next non-interrupt action. They do not suffer the effects of any ground conditions until they land (on their next non-interrupt action), but simultaneously are left exposed and easily juggled, and any unarmed attacks against them while they’re airborne will gain a bonus to their Accuracy and a reduction to their Speed for every point you beat their defense by, to a maximum of 5 for each (following normal Speed reduction limits).</p> <p>If used as the opener of a combo, the Accuracy maximum, and the Speed reduction, is reduced to 2 but both effects persist until your combo is broken (even after they’re no longer airborne).</p> <p>In the case of simultaneous actions, the opponent doesn’t count as having had an action until after the IC is resolved, meaning that if you perform Kage Buyou simultaneous to them, they will immediately count as having acted afterward, and you wouldn’t get the follow-up bonus (and they would immediately land), but if your follow-up attack is performed simultaneous to their next action, you would get Kage Buyou’s benefits (as they hadn’t yet landed).</p> <h4 id="-souji-reppuu---sweeping-gale-">–( Souji Reppuu - Sweeping Gale )–</h4> <p>By flipping forward into a crouch, the user builds momentum that’s used to instantly land and begin spinning on one foot, extending the other leg out while using chakra to enhance its density, rotating repeatedly to strike the knees of the enemy, simultaneously evading and tripping them.</p> <ul> <li>Stamina: 16</li> <li>Damage: (STR/8)d8</li> <li>Speed: 8</li> <li>Special: Interrupt</li> <li>Requires: Trip, Reppuu</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This follows the rules for the D-Rank Reppuu technique. If you hit, the opponent is automatically knocked prone (see Trip for its effects).</p> <h4 id="-uchikudakute-no-jutsu---shattering-hand-technique-">–( Uchikudakute no Jutsu - Shattering Hand Technique )–</h4> <p>Ninja can perform incredible feats of strength; after years of grueling training, some can literally reduce boulders to gravel for their bare fists. That’s a handy trick to have, but most ninja aren’t willing to go through the whole ‘years of pain and hard work’ part, so instead they invented a jutsu which accomplishes a similar effect: by channeling vibrating chakra through their hand at the moment of impact, most solid objects can be shattered with a single blow.</p> <ul> <li>Stamina: 20 + X</li> <li>Damage: (X + STR/8)d10</li> <li>Speed: 13</li> <li>Delay: X</li> </ul> <p>Effects: X has a minimum of 0, and a maximum of your PDB. When used against a person, roll location as if it had caused a wound (unless it was a called shot; if blocked, the defender chooses the location as usual). Before wounds or damage are calculated, this completely destroys any armor protecting the location it hits.</p> <p>It may also be used against objects, or out of battle. In this case, it destroys up to STR/10 cubic yards of inanimate objects, such as boulders or trees. For this to work, the material most be contiguous; used against a bridge made from wooden planks, only a single plank would shatter, though a wall held together with mortar would count as contiguous. Additionally, it can only target hard, inflexible materials (i.e. things capable of shattering); rocks are fair game, ropes are not.</p> <p>Two things to be aware of when using its secondary function. The first, it doesn’t work against objects which have been reinforced with chakra, such as through means of certain sealing jutsu. The second, it’s not nearly as effective as it might sound for “tunnelling” through walls, mountains, and the likes–ten cubic meters of shattered stone is still ten cubic meters of stone, just in small pieces.</p> <h4 id="-asshou---pressure-palm-">–( Asshou - Pressure Palm )–</h4> <p>You deliver a powerful, downwards palm blow to an opponent’s stomach or the small of their back, brutally knocking the wind from them and dazing them–repeated use of this can bruise a person’s solar plexus, which pretty much hurts more than anything has any right to, for weeks.</p> <ul> <li>Stamina: 24</li> <li>Damage: (STR/8)d8</li> <li>Speed: 20</li> </ul> <p>Effects: If it hits, its target immediately makes a Stamina 15 roll. If this hits a prone target, it also inflicts a Stun 12.</p> <h4 id="-spinning-backfist-">–( Spinning Backfist )–</h4> <p>With a burst of chakra to one of the user’s legs, they spin around and extend an arm to knock an opponent senseless with the back of their fist. It’s a powerful blow as it uses the weight and momentum of the user’s entire body, but has an inherent weakness of losing sight of the enemy while spinning.</p> <ul> <li>Stamina: 25</li> <li>Damage: (STR/8)d10</li> <li>Accuracy: -2</li> <li>Speed: 15</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This technique’s damage is tripled when determining the severity of wounds it inflicts.</p> <h4 id="-attsu-buchikomu---pain-driver-">–( Attsu Buchikomu - Pain Driver )–</h4> <p>A brutal technique, and completely inappropriate for training (because someone would have thought it was okay, if we didn’t say that). The attacker finds a weak point on their opponent’s body, the site of a previous injury, and strikes there to amplify the existing wound.</p> <ul> <li>Stamina: 20</li> <li>Damage: (STR/8)d6</li> <li>Speed: 12</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This attack must be a called shot, but can not itself cause a wound. Instead, if it targets a location with an existing Blunt wound. That wound is removed and replaced with a Wound of the next severity up. The wound escalation only applies if the attack deals damage.</p> <h4 id="-maboroshi-tejun---phantom-step-">–( Maboroshi Tejun - Phantom Step )–</h4> <p>Despite the fancy name, it’s a fairly simple ‘technique’. With a momentary burst of energy (and probably adrenaline, considering the circumstances where it’s likely to be used) the user does their best to get out of the way of an impending attack. The “phantom” came mostly from the way a shinobi using this can, to the untrained eye, seem almost to disappear. And because ninjas thought it sounded cool.</p> <ul> <li>Stamina: +X * 5</li> <li>Speed: +X</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This technique is used alongside a dodge attempt (or interrupts which function as a dodge, such as Leaping Shadow Evasion Technique), providing a +X bonus to your dodge roll. The increased Speed from Phantom Step cannot be reduced.</p> <h2 id="b-rank">B-Rank</h2> <h4 id="-chouyaku-kage-kaihi-no-jutsu---leaping-shadow-evasion-technique-">–( Chouyaku Kage Kaihi no Jutsu - Leaping Shadow Evasion Technique )–</h4> <p>You leap away from an attack, getting yourself safely out of range. However, you don’t pause to regain your orientation and settle into your new position, instead keeping ready to move again.</p> <ul> <li>Stamina: 20</li> <li>Special: Interrupt</li> <li>Speed: 4</li> </ul> <p>Effects: When you use Chouyaku Kage Kaihi, make a dodge roll. You may automatically attempt to dodge any incoming attacks, without having to take an action to do so, using Chouyaku Kage Kaihi’s result as your effective dodge roll. This lasts until you take any other action, including defensive interrupts.</p> <h4 id="-rankyaku---storm-kick-">–( Rankyaku - Storm Kick )–</h4> <p>Using this technique a shinobi kicks with extreme precision, not aiming at an opponent but instead kicking the air itself. Their leg slices through the air with such speed and precision that it compresses the air into a blade, aimed at the attack’s target.</p> <ul> <li>Stamina: 22</li> <li>Damage: (STR/6)d8</li> <li>Range: STR/4</li> <li>Speed: 14</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This cannot be parried (though ninjutsu-based defenses which work like parries still function). Rankyaku causes Slashing wounds. The first time this is used against a given opponent in battle it has a +2 Accuracy bonus.</p> <h4 id="-gouriki-senpuu---strong-whirlwind-">–( Gouriki Senpuu - Strong Whirlwind )–</h4> <p>Taking the Whirlwind back to the basics, the shinobi no longer bothers with a series of strikes, and instead just focuses their ability into a single roundhouse with more speed and power than the previous versions.</p> <ul> <li>Stamina: 26</li> <li>Damage: (STR/6)d12</li> <li>Speed: 16</li> <li>Area: STR/25</li> <li>Requires: Daisenpuu</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This damages everyone in range. If partial defense applies, this technique does 50% of its normal damage per point it hits by, rather than 20%. Anyone hit is knocked back STR/15 yards.</p> <h4 id="-shougekishou---upwards-attacking-palm-">–( Shougekishou - Upwards Attacking Palm )–</h4> <p>The shinobi brings their palm from waist height and strikes upwards to full extension. Though it’s difficult to connect with, if the user does hit they’ll send their opponent flying away.</p> <ul> <li>Stamina: 30</li> <li>Damage: (STR/6 +3)d12</li> <li>Accuracy: -3</li> <li>Speed: 16</li> </ul> <p>Effects: If you are the attacker in a grapple with your target, the Accuracy penalty is negated and if you hit, you also inflict a Stun 6. The grapple is ended if this technique hits. After being hit the opponent is knocked back (STR/10) yards and automatically knocked prone (see Trip for its effects).</p> <h4 id="-dai-dageki---heavy-blow-">–( Dai Dageki - Heavy Blow )–</h4> <p>One of the simplest hand to hand maneuvers at the highest of levels, this attack is straight and to the point. Sacrificing trickery or fancy techniques, you deliver a powerful blow with the full weight of your body behind it.</p> <ul> <li>Stamina: 28</li> <li>Damage: As basic Attack (including Power Attack and Unarmed Focus)</li> <li>Speed: 8</li> </ul> <p>Effects: Your damage bonus is doubled for this attack.</p> <h4 id="-gouken---iron-fist-">–( Gouken - Iron Fist )–</h4> <p>A generalized term for one school of thought for how to approach taijutsu, the idea behind ‘Iron Fist’ is to give every attack one’s all, aiming to cause the maximum amount of damage in as few strikes as possible. This often involves thrusting punches and short-range kicks, and is undeniably effective. The downside, however, is that putting all one’s force into a single blow results in telegraphing one’s motions to an observant opponent, and can quickly tire the user.</p> <ul> <li>Stamina: +X * 5</li> <li>Accuracy: +X/2</li> <li>Speed: +X</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This supplements another Unarmed jutsu, or basic unarmed attack. X has a maximum of STR/10, and you round down for all bonuses of X. That attack’s base Speed (including for damage calculations) is increased by X, and your Physical Damage Bonus is also increased by X.</p> <h4 id="-gawa-ryuu---river-style-">–( Gawa-Ryuu - River Style )–</h4> <p>The ultimate recourse of taijutsu fighters who are frustrated with only being able to land glancing blows on their opponents, this technique sends a surge of chakra through the attacking limb. This results in a burst of speed and strength, and also a chakra ‘shockwave’ along the edge of the attack that carries almost as much force as the strike itself.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: +(10 + X/3)</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This is activated after you hit with an Unarmed or Combo Taijutsu attack at melee range, but its damage is reduced by partial defense. X is that technique’s Stamina cost, after all modifications. When you activate River Style, your Accuracy with that attack is retroactively increased by 2, or the minimum value to do full damage (i.e. overcome partial defense), whichever is lower. Your opponent may spend Willpower on their defense after you’ve declared activation of River Style. If you then spend Willpower on your Accuracy, River Style’s effects last until your attack has been fully resolved.</p> <h2 id="a-rank">A-Rank</h2> <h4 id="-chishi-kakato-suto---deadly-heel-strike-">–( Chishi Kakato Suto - Deadly Heel Strike )–</h4> <p>Used as a killing blow, this technique is commonly performed upon a prone opponent, who is then cratered into the ground. Leaping into the air, the Shinobi comes down with a full power downward heel strike, usually aiming to smash the ribcage, crush a skull or even snap the spine of their target.. and destroy everything around them in the process.</p> <ul> <li>Stamina: 50</li> <li>Damage: (STR/4)d20</li> <li>Accuracy: -3</li> <li>Area: PDB*2</li> <li>Speed: 26</li> </ul> <p>Effects: Partial success does not apply to the actual target of this attack. Whether or not this technique hits or is successfully defended against, the target (and everyone else in its area) might still be hit by the shockwave of exploding earth all around them from the impact with the ground, which deals no base damage of its own, but applies this technique’s Speed<em>PDB damage to anyone caught in the area, losing 10% of its damage per point it missed by (so missing by 2 has it deal Speed</em>PDB*0.8, for example). Successfully parrying the attack does not prevent the shockwave damage, though if someone is airborne, they can avoid this secondary damage (which is typically only applicable against flying puppets or a target knocked airborne by Kage Buyou). Most notably, this does mean that the intended target of this technique, if hit, takes full damage from the shockwave, in addition to the attack’s full damage, as a single damage source (defenses and damage reduction applies only once to the combined damage, not separately against the hit and the shockwave).</p> <h4 id="-okasho---cherry-blossom-impact-">–( Okasho - Cherry Blossom Impact )–</h4> <p>Taking chakra infused muscles to the next level, the user focuses a massive amount of chakra into their fist, foot, or even fingertip. Upon striking the chakra is released into their target causing a great deal of damage. Given that the damage is dependent on the amount of chakra channeled, a truly great shinobi can even use this technique with a single fingertip.</p> <ul> <li>Stamina: 25</li> <li>Chakra: X</li> <li>Damage: (X + STR/8)d12</li> <li>Speed: 20</li> <li>Requires: Chakra Strengthening active, Chakra Control 30</li> </ul> <p>Effects: You add half your NDB (in addition to your PDB) to this technique’s damage. You may give this technique an Area of (X), though doing so reduces its damage dice to d8’s.</p> <h4 id="-shigan---finger-gun-">–( Shigan - Finger Gun )–</h4> <p>Using a single finger, the Shinobi strikes with speed and precision to drive their finger into an opponents body. There is a danger in the technique as an inaccurate strike can easily damage the user.</p> <ul> <li>Stamina: 40</li> <li>Damage: (STR/4)d6</li> <li>Accuracy: +3</li> <li>Speed: 15</li> <li>Special: Bleed 15</li> </ul> <p>Effects: Shigan is automatically a called shot (without the usual Accuracy penalty), and its damage is tripled for the purpose of inflicting wounds, and deals Piercing damage. If partial defense applies when Shigan hits, the attacker automatically suffers a Sprained Arm (Blunt, Major) wound as a result.</p> <h4 id="-benkei-do---way-of-benkei-">–( Benkei-do - Way of Benkei )–</h4> <p>A mixture of folk hero and mythical character, Benkei was a warrior monk known for his peerless skill in combat and unswerving loyalty to his master. One of the popular stories about his exploits involved Benkei guarding a bridge, holding back hundreds of warriors before finally succumbing to his wounds. This technique pays homage to his exploits, focusing all a shinobi’s efforts on defense.</p> <ul> <li>Stamina: +10</li> <li>Special: Interrupt</li> <li>Speed: +0</li> </ul> <p>Effects: You may activate Way of Benkei alongside a normal defense. Until your next action, your defenses have a (+1+X) bonus, with X being the number of times you’ve attempted to defend yourself (successfully or otherwise) since activating Way of Benkei (including the defense it was activated with). You may choose not to use Way of Benkei on a given defense; doing so does not reset its X value or require it to be reactivated. The only defenses which “count” for Way of Benkei are dodges and unarmed parries. You may use other defenses, but they do not receive its bonus or increase its X value. Way of Benkei ends when your take a non-Interrupt action, at which point you pay a secondary Stamina cost of 10+3*X, to a maximum of 40. You may declare Block, Total Defense, Guard, and similar effects without ending Way of Benkei.</p> <h4 id="-asahi-kyusho---rising-sun-strike-">–( Asahi Kyusho - Rising Sun Strike )–</h4> <p>A very impressive, though somewhat impractical, technique, the user gathers energy in one limb (typically a leg, though open-palm attacks are possible) and releases it in a single, swift strike with enough force to send their opponent flying. Though not technically required, it is suggested that anyone performing this technique shout its name emphatically when doing so. Generally speaking, the injuries from this technique come less from the initial impact and more from the landing, which is very rarely graceful. Thankfully, the victims of this technique have their dignity spared–they’re usually knocked too far away for anyone to see them wind up in a face-down heap after rolling through the dirt!</p> <ul> <li>Stamina: 30 + X/2</li> <li>Damage: (STR/4)d6</li> <li>Speed: 20, Delay X</li> <li>Special: Stun Y/2</li> </ul> <p>Effects: If you hit, the opponent is automatically knocked prone (see Trip for its effects), and they’re knocked back STR/4 * (its Speed, after any reductions /20) + (Delay)*(your Physical Damage Bonus)/2 yards. However, when Rising Sun Strike hits, make an Athletics roll with a -10 penalty, and a +X bonus, against your opponent’s Athletics. If their roll is greater than yours, the distance they’re knocked back is halved. For every 5 points they beat your roll by, increase the divisor by 1 (to /3 at 5, /4 at 10, and so on). They lose Y/2 AP, and this technique’s damage is considered Y%, where Y is the number of yards the target was knocked back.</p> </d-article> <d-appendix> <d-footnote-list></d-footnote-list> <d-citation-list></d-citation-list> </d-appendix> <d-bibliography src="/assets/bibliography/"></d-bibliography> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 Anchorsify .
