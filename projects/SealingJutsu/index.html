A series of symbols are written on the scroll, various items are placed on top of it, and the user performs the proper handseals. The items will vanished, stored inside the seal until they’re released. This can be done repeatedly, with each item corresponding to a separate symbol on the scroll. Items can be sealed and released all at once, or one at a time.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 10</li> <li>Speed: 8</li> <li>Seal Speed: 10</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This stores up to 50 pounds of objects inside a scroll. Releasing any number items is a Chakra 5, Speed 5 actions, which can be done by anyone who knows this technique. If used to release a weapon, it takes a separate action to ‘draw’ (grab and properly grasp) that weapon.</p> <h4 id="-soshoryu---twin-rising-dragons-">–( Soshoryu - Twin Rising Dragons )–</h4> <p>This requires two storage scrolls with projectile weapons stored inside of them. When this technique is used both the scrolls are launched into the air (giving the technique its name). The user can then jump up between them, grabbing and throwing various projectiles.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: +10</li> <li>Speed: +0</li> <li>Seal Speed: +8</li> <li>Requires: Two scrolls with thrown weapons sealed inside them</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This is a link added to a thrown weapon attack or multi-throw using weapons previously stored in scrolls with Confinement Scroll Seal. You unseal the weapons you need and immediately attack with them, without needing to unseal them as a separate action. When used with a multi-throw, you increase your DEX by CHA/2 for determining how many weapons you can throw. All weapons thrown must be sealed in the scrolls.</p> <p>You can also use this with the “Throw Weapon” ability (if you have it), allowing you to unseal and immediately attack with the melee weapon without needing to unseal them as a separate action.</p> <h4 id="-sougu-baku-ryuusei---manipulated-tools-attached-meteor-">–( Sougu: Baku Ryuusei - Manipulated Tools: Attached Meteor )–</h4> <p>Large, elongated sections of chains with weighted ends shoot out of a scroll and are directed toward an opponent. They spiral around and surround the victim before the slack is removed, binding the opponent and restricting movement. It does minimal damage on its own, but is useful as a setup for a more potent attack.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 16</li> <li>Speed: 10</li> <li>Seal Speed: 8</li> <li>Range: 12</li> <li>Requires: One Scroll</li> </ul> <p>Effects: You make a Ranged Taijutsu Attack. If you hit, this deals no damage but restrains the opponent, inflicting a -2 Immobilization penalty, increased by 1 per point your Accuracy exceeds their defensive roll, with a maximum of -7.</p> <p>The chains themselves are still attached to the scroll, and therefore sufficient movement on the part of the victim will reduce this penalty, lowering it by 1 per four yards moved. Alternately, they can try to just wrestle free as a Speed 6 action, rolling as the defender in a Grapple with a penalty equal to their Immobility penalty from this technique, while you use your NDB in place of PDB.</p> <h4 id="-shikoku-fuuin---finger-engraving-seal-">–( Shikoku Fuuin - Finger Engraving Seal )–</h4> <p>Concentrating chakra into your fingertip, this allows you to ‘write’ on any surface you please. On solid objects, this will cause a slight depression on the surface and stain it black. On flesh, this will cause slight discomfort and leave a scar, which is initially ink-black and lightens over the next few weeks to regular scar tissue.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 15</li> <li>Speed: 1 per word</li> </ul> <p>Effects: You can write on any surface. With chakra!</p> <h2 id="c-rank">C-Rank</h2> <h4 id="-fuukoku-houin---dark-sealing-method-">–( Fuukoku Houin - Dark Sealing Method )–</h4> <p>A once-specialized technique that’s been adapted to see broader use, the Dark Sealing Method is used when a simple lock just isn’t reliable enough. The user takes several paper tags, writes the appropriate seals on them in their own blood, and then applies them to the edge of the doorframe, lid, or other appropriate edge of what’s being sealed. After that, the handseals are performed and chakra is applied.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 20</li> <li>Speed: 15</li> <li>Seal Speed: 30</li> </ul> <p>Effects: The door or container the paper tags are placed upon cannot be opened so long as this seal is in place; no amount of physical force can overcome it. That said, it gives no special properties to what has been sealed; if you apply Fuukoku Houin to a rickety wooden door, most people would have minimal trouble breaking a hole in the center of that door. The tags themselves are virtually indestructible until the technique ends. When you apply this seal, you may specify a certain time for it to end, such as “two days from now”. The seal will last until the designated time arrives, or it’s removed by some method (such as the A-rank Five Elements Unseal). The person who placed this seal can simply peel the tags away from the sealed surface, destroying the seal in the process.</p> <h4 id="-sougu-tensasai---manipulated-tools-heavenly-chain-of-destruction-">–( Sougu: Tensasai - Manipulated Tools: Heavenly Chain of Destruction )–</h4> <p>An advanced form of Twin Rising Dragons, the user throws a scroll into the air and leaps after it. In midair the weapons inside the scroll are released and projected by the user’s chakra, allowing them to guide far more weapons than they would be able to by hand. It gets its name from the speed of its most proficient practitioners, who can propel their weapons so fast they appear as rays of light.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: Variable, Special</li> <li>Speed: As multi-throw</li> <li>Seal Speed: 15</li> <li>Requires: Soshoryu</li> </ul> <p>Effects: You perform a multi-throw technique using weapons stored inside one or more scrolls. The Chakra cost is equal to whatever the Stamina cost would normally be. Your ninjutsu damage bonus is used in place of your physical damage bonus.</p> <p>You may target any number of people within range, each with separate multi-throws. This has the same cost no matter how many people you target, but you must use the full number of weapons (if you “throw” 10 shurikens at 4 people, you’d need 40 shuriken total). This may not be used with senbon; it may also not be used to perform called shots.</p> <p>Alternately, by doubling the number of weapons you can make this an Area 10 attack, in which case it hits everything indiscriminately; by quadrupling the number of weapons required you can make it Area 20 centered on yourself, with you at the center. In either of these cases, the severity of wounds inflicted is reduced by one (additional) rank.</p> <p>As an example of how that works: If you have 80 DEX, you could throw 16 shuriken to hit everyone in Area 10, with the equivalent of an 8-shuriken multi-throw. The increase in damage bonus based on number of weapons thrown would be (8 * 0.5) = 4, not (16 * 0.5) = 8.</p> <h4 id="-netetsuki-no-jutsu---sleeping-moon-technique-">–( Netetsuki no Jutsu - Sleeping Moon Technique )–</h4> <p>An exceptionally useful technique, as it approaches the much yearned-for concept of a “smart” seal; one that can be deactivated easily without requiring extensive time and effort to then replace it. This is not actually a seal itself, but a large number of specific modifications which can be applied to almost any advanced sealing technique; less complicated sealing jutsu are too simple to incorporate these alterations.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: +10 + X * 3</li> <li>Seal Speed: +10</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This is used to supplement another sealing technique of rank C or higher. When you apply it, specify an activation condition and a deactivation condition. Possible triggers include:</p> <ul> <li>Someone passes within (up to 10) yards of it.</li> <li>There is nobody within (up to 10) yards of it.</li> <li>A certain word is said or noise is made.</li> <li>Someone touches the seal.</li> <li>A specific person touches the seal (see below).</li> </ul> <p>If keyed to touch-activation or -deactivation by specific people, you can specify up to X people, where X is (Research ranks)/5, who the seal will recognize by chakra signature; all of those people must be present when you apply the seal. When the activation condition occurs, the seal is activated. When the deactivation condition occurs, the seal becomes dormant; none of its effects apply until it’s reactivated, though it remains visible. Removing the seal augmented by Sleeping Moon Technique also removes this portion of the seal. Alternately, the Sleeping Moon seal could be removed, leaving the original seal in place but uncontrollable.</p> <h4 id="-tsuiseki-fuuin---tracking-seal-">–( Tsuiseki Fuuin - Tracking Seal )–</h4> <p>A very useful seal, though one which suffers from a number of limitations. When applied to a person, the seal vanishes almost immediately, becoming invisible and virtually undetectable, even to shinobi capable of seeing chakra (such as the Hyuuga and Uchiha). Afterwards, whoever applied the seal will be able to get a vague idea of the location of the sealed individual, allowing them to be tracked across any distance.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: +10, raised to +25 if it hits</li> <li>Speed: +8</li> <li>Special: Exclusive</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This is used as a link to any basic unarmed attack. If you hit, you roll Espionage + 5 opposed by your target’s Espionage. If you succeed, they think you simply hit them with a good punch or palm strike; if you fail, they realize you used some sort of jutsu on them, though not what its effect was.</p> <p>Once applied, the seal is invisible and undetectable. It will only be discovered by a sealing expert who knows to look for it. These seals have been known to go undetected for years, as a result.</p> <p>By forming a handseal and concentrating for several seconds you know the direction and approximate distance from your current location of the person(s) you’re tracking. This does not provide any bonuses in combat; while it lets you know your target is nearby, it lacks enough precision at such short distances to help you discover an opponent hidden in stealth. There is no limit on how often you may activate a Tracking Seal, though you have to stop and concentrate each time (and so cannot do it while moving).</p> <h2 id="b-rank">B-Rank</h2> <h4 id="-fuuyoso-houin---element-sealing-method-">–( Fuuyoso Houin - Element Sealing Method )–</h4> <p>Named because being able to put out fires is its primary use, this sealing technique actually allows for the retrieval of elemental matter of all kinds–-it just so happens that out of control fires are some of the most deadly disasters in human history. The proper seals must be written on the scroll, followed by the correct handseals. Once the technique is complete the element of the user’s choice will vanish entirely and be sealed within the scroll; the kanji for “seal” will appear on said scroll.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 20 + X * 2</li> <li>Range: 30</li> <li>Speed: 10</li> <li>Seal Speed: 25</li> </ul> <p>Effects: You can seal any of the five basic elements inside of scrolls! Up to (CHA) gallons or (CHA/5) square yards of elemental matter can be sealed this way. This works just as well with chakra-based instances of the element as with natural-made ones, but lacks any offensive capacity: If you try to remove ‘wind’ from an enclosed area, you do not create a vacuum, you simply still the air and thin it out. Similarly, you can’t remove earth from underneath someone to suck them up into it or trip them (though they might be in a hole). If you have to ask if you could use the jutsu in some sort of offensive capacity, assume the answer is ‘no’.</p> <p>You can also use this technique to immediately end any status effect based on an element being physically upon someone (so, mostly just Immobilize and Ignite), with X being the number of people you can do this do, to a maximum of (1 + Chakra Control Ranks/5).</p> <p>This jutsu may end an Upkeep or other persistent effect created by one of the five basic elements. X is equal to the higher of effect’s Rank (E = 1, D = 2, C = 3, etc) or Upkeep cost. Each use of this jutsu may only end one effect, and nothing prevents someone from activating that jutsu again later.</p> <p>Each use of this technique requires a blank scroll for the element to be sealed in. Once sealed, the elemental matter is effectively destroyed: it cannot be released, and the scroll cannot be reused.</p> <h4 id="-raikou-kenka---lightning-blade-creation-">–( Raikou Kenka - Lightning Blade Creation )–</h4> <p>A special ninja tool summoning technique, this allows weapons or other ninja tools to be sealed with a single symbol in a scroll or, more commonly, clothes. Touching this symbol and willing it active is all it takes to summon these tools.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 28</li> <li>Speed: 10</li> <li>Seal Speed: 45</li> <li>Special: Exclusive</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This seals up to (CHA /5) items in a seal, which is applied to the target item.</p> <p>You may summon weapons sealed with this technique as a Speed 0 Interrupt. In the case of melee weapons, this also replaces the regular action to draw the weapon. For thrown weapons, the first time you use this technique to unseal and then immediately attack with a thrown weapon it counts as a surprise attack. Any weapon or item in Equipment may be stored in these seals, though each seal may store only a single type of item (such as kunai, wakizashi, or smoke bombs).</p> <h4 id="-keiyaku-fuuin---contract-seal-">–( Keiyaku Fuuin - Contract Seal )–</h4> <p>Implemented on a summoner, this removes any control the summoner has over their summoned creature, and in most cases will temporarily nullify the contract altogether.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: +15, raised to +30 if it hits</li> <li>Speed: +10</li> <li>Special: Exclusive</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This is used as a link to any basic unarmed attack. Any summoning contracts the victim possesses are considered null and void until this seal is removed. In most cases, this will forcibly de-summon anything they’ve already summoned. Defensive Summoning techniques used against this automatically fail.</p> <h4 id="-tsuyome-fuuin---strengthening-seal-">–( Tsuyome Fuuin - Strengthening Seal )–</h4> <p>An advanced and demanding seal, this applies a resilient lattice of chakra to enhance the physical integrity of walls, floors, ceilings, and the like.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 30</li> <li>Speed: 16</li> <li>Seal Speed: 25</li> <li>Special: Exclusive</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This may be applied to any surface up to (CHA /10) square yards, and no thicker than (CHA /10) inches. You may divide the area by any whole number to multiply the thickness limitation by that much. For example, you could make it (CHA /10)/2 square yards, and in exchange apply the seal to a surface (CHA /10) * 2 inches thick. The seal is visible, though only on the side it’s applied to (so if it’s on the inside of a wall, you would not see it on the outside). Similarly, it can only be removed from that side. It may only be applied to a contiguous object: if you wanted to apply Strengthening Seal to a boat, each plank would require a separate seal. The surface this seal is on is virtually indestructible. It gains (user’s CHA) * 10 HP, and has a damage reduction of (user’s CHA), which cannot be bypassed or reduced. This seal can only be applied to flat surfaces, such as walls. The blade of a weapon, just as an example, would not be a valid target.</p> <h4 id="-shinsei-chinmoku-fuuin---sacred-silence-seal-">–( Shinsei Chinmoku Fuuin - Sacred Silence Seal )–</h4> <p>Often used as a form of so-called ‘loyalty seal’, this has seen moderate popularity among various clandestine and/or extremist organizations within the ninja villages, as well as a means of helping ensure that double agents don’t turn into triple agents.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: +15, raised to +30 if it hits</li> <li>Speed: +10</li> <li>Accuracy: -3</li> <li>Special: Exclusive</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This is used as a link to any basic unarmed attack. When you apply this seal to a person, specify a topic. This may be as broad (“anything involving Sand village”) or as narrow (“the new jutsu you saw me use”) as you wish.</p> <p>The victim may not attempt to communicate about that topic in any way, be it through speech, writing, or other methods. Intent is what matters here; if they think they’re giving information about the subject, they are unable to. The same restrictions apply regarding this seal itself. That said, it’s not particularly inconspicuous. While the seal itself prevents the victim from showing it off, it takes the form of a hexagram somewhere on their torso, back, or tongue (in which case it can’t be seen without the person actually sticking their tongue out and someone checking for it) and is easily identifiable by anyone with Seal Training.</p> <p>You may, when applying this seal, also specify one exception to its restrictions. For example, you could say “other Leaf nin”–in which case the person with this seal could talk to other Leaf nin about the sealed topic, but nobody else. This seal trumps any genjutsu short of the Poison Truth Technique.</p> <h4 id="-moji-hyouki-no-jutsu---rune-inscribing-technique-">–( Moji Hyouki no Jutsu - Rune Inscribing Technique )–</h4> <p>A tricky seal, this allows the user to mold the chakra necessary for any ninjutsu technique they know and then ‘freeze’ it, holding it primed but inactive inside of a seal. Once a trigger condition occurs, the jutsu is released. Use of this technique to prepare explosive Katon techniques and leaving them around as a practical joke is strongly discouraged.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 20 + X</li> <li>Speed: 20 + X</li> <li>Seal Speed: 20 + X</li> <li>Special: Exclusive</li> </ul> <p>Effects: When you use Moji Hyouki, select another ninjutsu which you are able to perform, specifying all its variable parameters at that time. The “X” for Moji Hyouki refers to the ninjutsu you choose, which can not have a cost other than Chakra Exhaustion (such as Willpower, or Stamina).</p> <p>Moji Hyouki can be placed on any reasonably flat, solid surface that’s at least one foot across in each direction, such as a floor or a box (notably, this can’t be placed on any item found in Equipment, nor may it be placed on anything you could bring into combat with you). Once applied, the seal will either vanish (making a potentially effective trap) or remain visible as an elaborate set of seals that can be identified by anyone familiar with the technique (as a warning of sorts). Even if Moji Hyouki is identified, the technique placed in it will not be. When the seal is placed, an activation condition is specified. The three possible activation conditions are:</p> <ul> <li>Someone comes within five feet of the seal.</li> <li>Someone touches the seal.</li> <li>If the seal is on a door or container, it may be set to activate when said door or container is opened.</li> </ul> <p>When the seal activates, the jutsu in question will immediately take effect. If this is an offensive technique it will be aimed at the person who set it off (unless it’s an AoE, in which case it will be centered on the seal). Offensive techniques used this way use your Accuracy at the time of its creation, unmodified by things such as status effects, wounds, fatigue, or temporary bonuses or penalties, and have a -2 Accuracy penalty per rank of the Technique. The A-rank Five Elements Unseal will not trigger a touch activated Moji Hyouki.</p> <p>Jutsu which are upkeeps will have no chakra source from which to draw from (given it is on an object), and will therefore immediately end after activation. Similarly, Jutsu with a range or an effect that only applies to oneself will then only apply to, and work on, the object it was placed on.</p> <p>Attempting to seal an object with Moji Hyouki on it (such as inside a Confinement Seal Scroll, or Lightning Blade Creation) causes Mojji Houki to immediately activate.</p> <h2 id="a-rank">A-Rank</h2> <h4 id="-tensha-fuuin---transcription-seal-">–( Tensha Fuuin - Transcription Seal )–</h4> <p>A rarely-seen technique, this seals the necessary chakra patterns for a specific jutsu inside a person, and keeps it perpetually ready within this seal. When a certain condition is met the seal activated and the technique is triggered.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 30</li> <li>Range: Touch</li> <li>Speed: 20</li> <li>Seal Speed: 35</li> <li>Special: Exclusive</li> </ul> <p>Effects: When used, declare another technique which you know, pay its cost, and specify a condition. The technique immediately and involuntarily activates when that condition is met.</p> <p>Possible conditions include “when you see the daimyo” and “when you hear the word ‘orange’ “. A target can be specified within reason (such as “the daimyo”, or “whoever said that word”).</p> <p>The technique stored inside a Transciption Seal may not be a Taijutsu, nor may it have a cost of any kind other than Chakra Exhaustion (such as Willpower, or Stamina). If it is a Genjutsu or Sealing technique, it can apply to the person the Transcription Seal was placed on or the person who triggered the seal, as you prefer. If the technique in question has an Upkeep, the person the Seal was placed on immediately takes on the Upkeep, and can accordingly dismiss it at any time. A person may only have one Transcription Seal on them at a time. This seal is invisible and undetectable except for by a Fuuinjutsu expert who knows to look for it.</p> <h4 id="-gogyou-fuuin---five-elements-seal-">–( Gogyou Fuuin - Five Elements Seal )–</h4> <p>This jutsu produces a powerful seal that disrupts the flow of chakra in the target. In most cases this is crippling.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: +20, raised to +40 if it hits</li> <li>Speed: +12</li> <li>Accuracy: -5</li> <li>Special: Exclusive</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This is used as a link to any basic unarmed attack. If you hit, The unfortunate victim has a -20 penalty to all Chakra Exhaustion rolls, and has their Chakra Control skill ranks reduced by 15, which can also temporarily lower their ranks in abilities (such as Water Walking). Any jutsu with Upkeeps they have activated end immediately due to the disruption of their chakra.</p> <p>If they fail a Chakra Exhaustion roll, they fail to use the jutsu they were trying to (but still advance a Fatigue category as normal). Furthermore, even if they succeed they must pass a Chakra Control check against the technique’s Chakra cost or fail anyway.</p> <h4 id="-gogyou-kaiin---five-elements-unseal-">–( Gogyou Kaiin - Five Elements Unseal )–</h4> <p>The opposite of the Five Elements Seal, but of much broader utility, this technique can remove any seal of equal or lesser strength.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: +20, raised to +40 if it hits</li> <li>Speed: +14</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This is used as a link to any basic unarmed attack, and can target a single seal on an object or person; On an object it typically doesn’t have any associated Accuracy to worry about, but on a person it requires a Called Shot be made to the part of the body where the Seal is located. On a hit, That seal is removed. This affects any seals described in this section. This technique may be able to remove seals not described in the PHB… or, it may not.</p> <h4 id="-fuuja-houin---evil-sealing-method-">–( Fuuja Houin - Evil Sealing Method )–</h4> <p>Not all seals can be removed easily. This circumvents that by suppressing Fuuinjutsu, Juuinjutsu, or any sort of chakra-based markings, on a person. The technique’s greatest failing is its dependence upon the recipient to provide some of the strength behind it, meaning they can overcome its effects at will, making it useless for offensive applications.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 30</li> <li>Range: Touch</li> <li>Speed: 10</li> <li>Seal Speed: 20</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This suppresses any seal in this section of the PHB, and many which are not. While the seal won’t be removed, it won’t activate or have any of its normal effects as long as the Evil Sealing Method remains in place. This technique is dependent upon the recipient’s willpower: all a person has to do is focus and the Evil Sealing Method will be disabled, until they spend 1 Willpower to reactivate it. Virtually any long-term chakra-based effect (even ones that aren’t actually fuuinjutsu) can be suppressed by it. Even the effects and abilities of bloodlines can be sealed.</p> <h4 id="-tsute-fuuin---influence-seal-">–( Tsute Fuuin - Influence Seal )–</h4> <p>This seal was originally created and placed upon servants of the Diamyo, ensuring those closest to them could not spy or sabotage the feudal lords. Over time, shinobi adapted to suit their own needs, which naturally meant that it found a usage in combat.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: +20, raised to +36 if it hits</li> <li>Speed: +12</li> <li>Special: Exclusive</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This is used as a link to any basic unarmed attack. When you hit, make an opposed Espionage roll: If you succeed, the seal is placed without the target knowing.</p> <p>The seal is inactive by default, but as a Speed 4, Chakra 10 + X interrupt in response to any non-interrupt action they take, you can create a temporary form of paralysis which turns their own Chakra against them, preventing the action they were going to perform, and forcing them to make a Chakra (X * 2) roll. If they fail, they are not fatigued, and they do not roll the Chakra or Stamina rolls associated with their action, as they are prevented from performing it. Their IC is not advanced by the action’s Speed, and instead they suffer a Stun 5. X has a maximum value of your Chakra Control Ranks.</p> <p>Every time that a victim has previously had to roll against this seal’s effects, they gain a +3 to their Chakra Exhaustion roll to overcome its effects. After they’ve succeeded on one such roll, the seal is forced into remission, and will not affect them temporarily; it cannot be reapplied or reactivated for the rest of that fight. Once the seal is subdued, it is, as far as the victim can tell, gone entirely, its effects having been broken. However, after 24 hours have passed the seal can be reactivated by its user, per the normal rules, with the cumulative bonus to resist it reset. A Fuuinjutsu expert will be able to, if they know someone has had this seal applied to them, find and remove it using the A-rank Five Elements Unseal technique.</p> <h4 id="-ketsumei-no-tsurugi---sword-of-blood-oath-">–( Ketsumei no Tsurugi - Sword of Blood Oath )–</h4> <p>This seal creates what is essentially a modified version of the blood pacts many shinobi form with summoned creatures. Rather than a powerful and intelligent animal, however, this ‘contract’ is made with a favored weapon.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 40</li> <li>Speed: 20</li> <li>Seal Speed: 40</li> <li>Special: Exclusive</li> </ul> <p>Effects: You can seal a single weapon with this technique. The weapon vanishes, and the seal for this technique manifests somewhere of your choosing on your body–usually the user’s forearms. You can summon the sealed weapon as a Speed 0 Interrupt, already ‘drawn’. As a Speed 1 action, you may return it to the seal, in which case it vanishes in a puff of smoke; you must actually have the weapon with you to do this. If the weapon is broken, or taken more than a mile away from you, it vanishes in a puff of smoke. In this case it will not be available for summoning for one hour. However, it is, for most intents and purposes, indestructible and impossible to lose in any permanent sense. The seal is invisible while the weapon is stored within it, but becomes (and remains) visible on your body so long as the weapon is withdrawn.</p> <h4 id="-nenshou-fuuin---burning-seal-">–( Nenshou Fuuin - Burning Seal )–</h4> <p>A highly-specialized, highly-effective sealing technique used to prevent an individual from handling weapons. Though it’s applied as a single seal, it appears on both the recipient’s (or rather, victim’s) hands, clearly recognizable as some form of ninja sealing technique or tattoo meant to emulate one. Whenever the recipient holds a weapon, the seal activates. As the lines of the seal begin glowing a dark, heated red, the victim’s skin will start to burn and smolder. Within seconds their flesh will start to smoke as they’re baked alive; if one is willful or self-destructive enough to not drop the weapon they’re holding, they’ll soon have their arms reduced into charred, blackened husks.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: +20, raised to +40 if it hits</li> <li>Speed: +14</li> <li>Special: Exclusive</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This is used as a link to any basic unarmed attack. On a hit, you apply the seal, which activates whenever the person it’s applied to holds a weapon. After 10 IC, a Minor Energy Wound is inflicted to whichever arm they were holding the weapon with; in the case of a two handed weapon, this is both arms. Dropping the weapon will end this technique’s effects immediately. If they’re currently suffering from a wound inflicted by the Burning Seal, it instead inflicts a wound of one higher category on that arm: Major, then Severe, then finally Critical. For example, if a shinobi drew a nodachi and decided to use it one-handed (holding it in their right hand) starting on IC 12, on IC 22 they would suffer a Minor Energy wound to their right arm. If they then began two-handing it, on IC 32 they would have a Minor on their left arm and a Major (in addition to the existing Minor) on their right. On IC 42 those would be Major and Severe; on IC 52, they would become Severe and Critical; and finally, by IC 62 they would have a Critical Energy wound on both arms.</p> </d-article> <d-appendix> <d-footnote-list></d-footnote-list> <d-citation-list></d-citation-list> </d-appendix> <d-bibliography src="/assets/bibliography/"></d-bibliography> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 Anchorsify .
