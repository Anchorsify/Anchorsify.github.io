It’s not terribly practical, but it does provide about a quarter-second of a distraction.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 5</li> <li>Special: Interrupt</li> <li>Speed: +3</li> <li>Seal Speed: 4</li> <li>Requires: 4 gallons of water</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This is used alongside a Dodge action, and provides it with a +3 bonus.</p> <h4 id="-mizu-souzou-no-jutsu---water-creation-technique-">–( Mizu Souzou no Jutsu - Water Creation Technique )–</h4> <p>You convert raw chakra into pure water. This technique is popular among serious users of suiton techniques, as it lets them avoid picking and choosing their battles so carefully, and allows them to eschew the practice of carrying around large gourds of water (which, in addition to giving away their specialty, are unpleasantly heavy).</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: X</li> <li>Speed: +X</li> <li>Seal Speed: 5</li> </ul> <p>Effects: You create X gallons of water which are added to the battlefield, to a maximum of 4+(Chakra Control ranks)/5; the Chakra cost has a minimum of 5. This may be used alongside a technique, adding its Chakra cost, Speed and Seal Speed to that technique’s, and it contributes directly to that technique’s gallon requirements.</p> <h4 id="-haneru---splash-">–( Haneru - Splash )–</h4> <p>You use Splash!</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 5</li> <li>Speed: 4</li> <li>Seal Speed: 2</li> </ul> <p>Effects: Nothing happens!</p> <h2 id="d-rank">D-Rank</h2> <h4 id="-teppoudama---liquid-bullet-">–( Teppoudama - Liquid Bullet )–</h4> <p>The user kneads chakra and converts it into water inside their stomach, then spits it out in the form of a dense, chakra-propelled ball. Its greatest boon to suiton users is that it can be used to create water while attacking, opening up other Suiton techniques.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 12</li> <li>Damage: 8d12+24</li> <li>Range: 10</li> <li>Speed: 10</li> <li>Seal Speed: 7</li> </ul> <p>Effects: Adds 4 gallons of water to the battlefield.</p> <h4 id="-takigakure-ryu-mizukiri-no-yaiba---hidden-waterfall-style-water-cutting-blade-">–( Takigakure Ryu, Mizukiri no Yaiba - Hidden Waterfall Style, Water-Cutting Blade )–</h4> <p>Originally developed by the Hidden Waterfall village, this technique has since spread into wider use. The first half of the name is generally dropped, though some choose to keep it out of respect. The jutsu creates a blade out of water, kept as strong as most metals by the chakra infusing it.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 12</li> <li>Upkeep: 2</li> <li>Speed: 10</li> <li>Seal Speed: 10</li> <li>Requires: (weapon dice)/2 gallons of water</li> </ul> <p>Effects: You acquire a sword, with the appropriate attributes for any of the ones in the Equipment chapter. Attacks with this sword use your physical or ninjutsu damage bonus, whichever you prefer, and can have its damage bonus changed (between ninjutsu or physical) for any attack made with it. You may perform handseals while holding this sword at no penalty if it is one-handed (or if you can make seals one-handed), or at a -6 penalty if it is two-handed.</p> <h4 id="-kirigakure-no-jutsu---hidden-mist-technique-">–( Kirigakure no Jutsu - Hidden Mist Technique )–</h4> <p>This technique was once a specialty of the village it’s named after, but has since fallen into wider use. The user diffuses a large quantity of water into the air, mixing their chakra with it to create a thick, oppressive mist.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 16</li> <li>Upkeep: 4</li> <li>Area: 25</li> <li>Speed: 10</li> <li>Seal Speed: 12</li> <li>Requires: 16 gallons of water</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This imposes a -3 Visibility Penalty to everyone in the area, which increases by 1 per 10 IC it’s maintained, to a maximum penalty of -6. So long as you maintain its upkeep, the gallons of water used in this technique are considered removed from the battlefield (and can not be used for other techniques until its visibility penalty goes away). When this technique ends, only half of its gallons are added back to the battlefield (the other half simply dissipates).</p> <p>If this technique has its visibility penalty reduced by other jutsu (such as by the E-rank Fuuton, Cleansing Winds) then it regains 1 point of its penalty every 5 IC that pass, so long as you maintain its Upkeep. On the other hand, effects which remove it entirely (such as the A-rank Fuuton, The North Wind) will, indeed, remove it (and end the Upkeep automatically). If this technique ends because you stop paying the Upkeep, its Visibility Penalty lowers by 1 per 5 IC which pass.</p> <h4 id="-mizutamari-no-jutsu---pool-of-water-technique-">–( Mizutamari no Jutsu - Pool of Water Technique )–</h4> <p>A moderately advanced technique is the appropriately named water-walking technique; molding chakra below one’s feet to ‘stand’ on patches of water without any actual expenditure of energy, and, once it’s perfected, only minimal concentration. This technique builds upon that concept, creating a ‘cushion’ of static, almost-solid water beneath each foot that the ninja stands on to avoid direct contact with the ground.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 10</li> <li>Upkeep: 2</li> <li>Speed: 12</li> <li>Seal Speed: 8</li> <li>Requires: 4 gallons of water, 10 Chakra Control</li> </ul> <p>Effects: You reduce any terrain-based immobilization penalties by 2, and ignore any other mechanical effects (such as damage for walking across caltrops) if they’re C-rank or lower; if they’re B-rank above, you instead halve them. This does mean that you are not directly in contact with the ground (for the purposes of, say, the Doton jutsu Shindou and Yurokensei).</p> <h4 id="-gyoushuu-no-tebukuro---gloves-of-cohesion-">–( Gyoushuu no Tebukuro - Gloves of Cohesion )–</h4> <p>You mold chakra around your palms to maintain a thick film of water around them, similar to how it’s possible for a ninja with excellent chakra control to stand on walls, or, well, water. This uses an extension of that sort of chakra control, using the water film as a medium to latch on to other people.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 12</li> <li>Upkeep: 2</li> <li>Speed: 10</li> <li>Requires: 4 gallons of water, 10 Chakra Control</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This gives you a +4 bonus to all grapple rolls you make (though it does not apply to weapons), for any purpose other than escaping a grapple (so not applicable for Kagemane).</p> <h4 id="-mekkyaku---extinguishment-">–( Mekkyaku - Extinguishment )–</h4> <p>It was recently discovered that covering oneself in water is a highly effective countermeasure to being on fire! Thus, this technique: An alternative to the ever-popular “stop, drop, and roll”, the ninja drenches themselves or a nearby object in water.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 8 + X</li> <li>Speed: 8</li> <li>Seal Speed: 8</li> <li>Requires: X*2 gallons of water</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This reduces any Ignite penalties you are suffering from by X; the gallons of water used in this technique are removed from the battlefield. You gain control over the water used in this technique for the next (Chakra Control ranks)*2 IC or until you use the gallons in a jutsu, as if you’d carried it into battle with you via a gourd or something similar (meaning, no one else may use or access it).</p> <h2 id="c-rank">C-Rank</h2> <h4 id="-suikoudan---water-shark-blast-">–( Suikoudan - Water Shark Blast )–</h4> <p>After creating the handseals, you launch water in projectile form at an opponent. Some ninja like to etch the outline of a shark’s head into the end of this projectile; others, who believe that being a ninja is very serious business, prefer to omit that part of the technique. Experienced users can even use this to allow themselves to fly quickly through the water, while protecting themselves with the might of the tearing shark.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 20</li> <li>Damage: 12d12+56</li> <li>Range: 20</li> <li>Speed: 14</li> <li>Seal Speed: 13</li> <li>Requires: 8 gallons of water</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This technique travels in a line from you to its target (or its maximum range). You may move a number of yards equal to the final Speed of this attack along that line as part of this technique, unhindered by anything which would normally prevent you from moving. The gallons of water used in this technique are removed from the battlefield.</p> <h4 id="-mizurappa---violent-water-wave-">–( Mizurappa - Violent Water Wave )–</h4> <p>Inhaling a large amount of air and performing the necessary seals, the user will expel a copious amount of water from his/her mouth. The wave of water produced will slam against its opponent and can then be utilized for other techniques.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 16</li> <li>Damage: 12d10+30</li> <li>Accuracy: +2</li> <li>Range: 15</li> <li>Speed: 12</li> <li>Seal Speed: 12</li> </ul> <p>Effects: Adds 8 gallons of water to the battlefield.</p> <h4 id="-suiben---water-whip-">–( Suiben - Water Whip )–</h4> <p>This creates, as its name suggests, a whip made from water which is held together by chakra. Aside from being a fairly useful weapon, it can prove useful for binding enemies, as the user can direct its motions with their chakra.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 18</li> <li>Upkeep: 3</li> <li>Speed: 10</li> <li>Seal Speed: 14</li> <li>Requires: 8 gallons of water</li> </ul> <p>Effects: You create a whip made out of water. It is a a Stamina 11, Damage 6d10, Speed 10, Range 8 Melee Slashing Chain weapon. It uses the higher of your Ninjutsu or Physical Damage Bonus, and you can change which you apply to any given attack (chosen when you make the attack). You may perform handseals while holding the whip at no penalty.</p> <p>As a Speed 10 action, you may use the whip to grab hold of someone, as per the E-rank Grapple technique. You use your CHA rather than your STR for grapple checks using the whip. Your opponent is considered to be ‘grappling’ the whip, not you. Although the whip itself can not be targeted by the person grappled by it, it has HP equal to your CHA, and can be attacked by outside sources (or struck by area of effect attacks), and reducing the whip’s HP to 0 ends the grapple immediately. The whip can not be attacked and is not caught by area of effect attacks when not being used to grapple someone, however. The victim can not shift a grapple with a water whip, only break it. You can use the whip to perform any valid Grapple techniques which you know of C-rank or below, using your CHA in place of your STR, except for Headbutt, Suplex, and Pressure Point, replacing the Grapple technique’s normal Stamina cost with a Chakra cost. It is considered to have unlimited limbs, using your chakra to reshape the whip as necessary. Additionally, you may direct Raiton techniques through the whip. This may be done with techniques of E- and D-rank. It may done with a C-rank technique, but doing so destroys the whip in the process. These techniques can not be dodged (as they’re being grappled by the whip), but can be blocked.</p> <h4 id="-mizuame-nabara---syrup-capture-field-">–( Mizuame Nabara - Syrup Capture Field )–</h4> <p>The user converts chakra into water, and infuses it with enough chakra to alter its composition, making it extremely viscous. They then spit it out in a stream of sticky, highly adhesive liquid.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 20</li> <li>Upkeep: 4</li> <li>Range: 25</li> <li>Area: 20</li> <li>Speed: 16</li> <li>Seal Speed: 14</li> <li>Requires: (Area)/3 gallons of water</li> </ul> <p>Effects: Everyone within the area of this technique takes a -4 Immobilization penalty; anyone with the Water Walking ability instead only takes a -2 penalty, which remains until you leave its area. This technique’s effects remain regardless of whether you maintain its Upkeep, however while you do maintain it, you can control the syrup field to make it ‘grab’ someone, using your CHA in place of STR to make a grapple roll against them (with you as the attacker) as a Speed 8 action; if you succeed against them, they are caught and take the full -4 Immobilization penalty regardless of whether or not they have the Water Walking ability. The syrup field can only grab someone within its area.</p> <h4 id="-mizu-bunshin-no-jutsu---water-clone-technique-">–( Mizu Bunshin no Jutsu - Water Clone Technique )–</h4> <p>An advanced form of the standard Bunshin no Jutsu, this creates clones out of water. Since they’re solid (well, relatively) these clones can be used to perform tasks the user is unable or unwilling to do for themselves. While they’re weaker than their user, they can still prove dangerous in combat.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 12, +3 per clone</li> <li>Speed: 10, +1 per clone</li> <li>Seal Speed: 4, +2 per clone</li> <li>Requires: 6 gallons of water per clone, Bunshin no Jutsu</li> </ul> <p>Effects: The gallons of water used to create clones are removed from the battlefield as they are made; clones which are dispersed voluntarily have the water used to create them added back to the battlefield, but clones that are destroyed do not, and the water used in their creation is simply lost. These function like normal clones (limited to 3, etc), but you may direct them to take actions by spending your AP. They may use basic unarmed attacks, or basic weapon attacks (weapons can be added to clones when they’re created for 1 gallon per 4 dice of weaponry, rounding up). These clones use your regular attributes, but use your ninjutsu damage bonus as their physical damage bonus. A water clone which takes damage from any source is destroyed.</p> <ul> <li>[Variable AP] Move: The clone may move around the battlefield. This costs 1 AP per 2 IC it spends moving.</li> <li>[Variable AP] The clone may make any basic unarmed or weapon attack, by paying 1 AP per 2 Speed of that action.</li> <li>[10 AP] The clone can use itself to create a water prison (as per Suiton: Suirou no Jutsu). This is considered a Speed 14 action with no associated Fatigue cost or gallons of water requirement. The clone remains present, but can take no other non-defensive actions, while maintaining the water prison. The water prison lasts for 10 + (Chakra Control ranks)/2 IC, after which the clone is destroyed and the prison ends unless you or another water clone touches to water prison to maintain the technique (and take on the normal Upkeep), following its normal restrictions. If you go to the prison you can take it over, and from then on must keep one hand in contact with it as per the normal rules for that technique.</li> </ul> <p>When Water Clones attack, their actions are always considered to be Held Back, as per the ability in Chapter 5, even if you do not have the Hold Back ability. This means they use only half your damage bonus for dealing damage, and the severity of wounds they inflict is reduced by one category. Water Clones use your base Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion bonuses, as if they were a Fatigue 1 version of you without any temporary benefits (such as having eaten a Soldier Pill before creating them). If a clone fails a Fatigue roll, it vanishes just as if it had been struck.</p> <h4 id="-mizugakure-no-jutsu---hidden-in-water-technique-">–( Mizugakure no Jutsu - Hidden in Water Technique )–</h4> <p>The user sinks into a shallow pool of water, much too little to actually fit a person (it’s ninja magic, don’t ask questions), where they’ll be able to easily lie in wait for a target to pass by, or spy on someone who might be near.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 16</li> <li>Upkeep: 4</li> <li>Speed: 18</li> <li>Seal Speed: 12</li> <li>Requires: 16 gallons of water</li> </ul> <p>Effects: You can use this technique to slip into a pool of water to hide, assuming you meet hiding’s normal requirements (i.e., this technique does not let you hide in itself). While hidden within water using this technique, your minimum Stealth level is 2. If an opponent does not have a reason to suspect you’re there (i.e. this isn’t being done in-combat) you have a +10 Stealth bonus. You have awareness equivalent to being able to look out of the pool as if it’s a window, but obviously can not move (because you’re in the water!) The puddle being destroyed, evaporated, or attacked in any way or washed away in more water, results in you being harmlessly ejected. Notably, this can only be used in puddles; anything more than a few inches deep probably doesn’t qualify. If it’s an actual pond, or lake, or the like, it’s not a valid target.</p> <h4 id="-suirou-no-jutsu---water-prison-technique-">–( Suirou no Jutsu - Water Prison Technique )–</h4> <p>The user gathers the chakra around their hand, and forms the required water into a sphere which encloses its victim. Due to the density of the chakra used in this technique, the water is stronger than steel. It is not, however, airtight. Yeah, don’t ask how that works. We don’t know either.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 22</li> <li>Upkeep: 5</li> <li>Range: Melee</li> <li>Speed: 12</li> <li>Seal Speed: 14</li> <li>Requires: 16 gallons of water</li> </ul> <p>Effects: You trap your target inside a sphere of water. Someone inside cannot take actions, but they also cannot be affected by anything outside the prison; yes, that’s right, the water can even stop giant swords. It makes sense, honestly, we promise, somehow. Anyone with a Chakra Control skill of 5 or above is able to mold the chakra around them to allow themselves to siphon air through the prison, meaning they can still talk and breathe. Anyone with less, however, adds a Suffocation 1 status every 10 IC. You must keep one hand on the water prison to maintain it, and you can not move or dodge while maintaining it; if you choose to dodge against an incoming attack, the water prison automatically ends. If you take damage while maintaining the water prison, you must make a Chakra Control check against (damage taken)/10 or the prison ends. Although you can’t move, you can still take most other actions that are possible one-handed while maintaining the prison’s upkeep.</p> <h4 id="-takitsubo-no-jutsu-water-release-waterfall-basin-technique-">–( Takitsubo no Jutsu: Water Release: Waterfall Basin Technique )–</h4> <p>This technique draws water up from underground, forming a geyser on the surface. Aside from being useful for creating a spot to relax when resting or camping out, and ensuring you’ll always have a source of clean (well… for a certain value of clean) water, it, like most ninjutsu, has combat applications.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 24</li> <li>Speed: 14</li> <li>Seal Speed: 18</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This produces 2 gallon of water on the battlefield every 3 IC, for a total of 50 gallons over 75 IC. It’s certainly possible to have multiple instances of this jutsu running simultaneously, from multiple people, or the same person.</p> <h4 id="-umi-no-tate-no-jutsu---ocean-shield-technique-">–( Umi no Tate no Jutsu - Ocean Shield Technique )–</h4> <p>A derivative of a more advanced technique, this was created to help teach up-and-coming suiton users the foundations of that jutsu, and help keep them alive until they were skilled enough to learn it. It creates a circular barrier of water around you, which surges up to protect you from… well, whatever convinced you that you’d need to use this technique.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 17</li> <li>Special: Interrupt</li> <li>Speed: 10</li> <li>Seal Speed: 8</li> <li>Requires: 8 gallons of water</li> </ul> <p>Effects: Make an accuracy roll against an incoming attack, with a bonus of NDB/2 or this technique’s final, modified Speed, whichever is lower. If you meet or exceed the attack’s accuracy, you protect yourself from it completely. This works against Katon up to B rank, Doton up to D-rank, and all other jutsu (including Taijutsu) up to C-rank, and uses up a number of gallons equal to twice the rank of the technique it’s used against, which are removed from the battlefield thereafter (basic attacks, however, do not have any gallons of water lost in this way).</p> <h2 id="b-rank">B-Rank</h2> <h4 id="-suigadan---water-fang-bullet-">–( Suigadan - Water Fang Bullet )–</h4> <p>This move forms multiple pressurized, spiralling columns of water that have a drill-like ability to pierce and destroy their target. As this attack can originate from any body of water (rather than being shot directly from the attacker), in the right environments this has a 360 degree range of attack, making it incredibly difficult to defend against adequately.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 28</li> <li>Damage: 10d20+60</li> <li>Accuracy: +1</li> <li>Speed: 10</li> <li>Range: 30</li> <li>Speed: 14</li> <li>Seal Speed: 16</li> <li>Requires: 16 gallons</li> </ul> <p>Effects: Once per battle, you can choose to ‘use up’ the gallons of water used in this technique in order to make an automatic Surprise Attack, removing them from the battlefield. This technique inflicts Piercing wounds.</p> <h4 id="-suiryuudan---water-dragon-blast-">–( Suiryuudan - Water Dragon Blast )–</h4> <p>This technique shapes a large amount of water into a giant, dragon-shaped projectile which seeks out and crashes into whoever you direct it at. What it lacks for in complexity, it makes up for by being a highly effective tool in any suiton using shinobi’s arsenal.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 33</li> <li>Damage: 14d20+140</li> <li>Accuracy: +1</li> <li>Range: 40</li> <li>Special: Stun 10</li> <li>Speed: 18</li> <li>Seal Speed: 22</li> <li>Requires: 24 gallons of water</li> </ul> <p>Effects: If the victim fails a status roll this inflicts Stun 10. Half the gallons of water used in this technique are removed from the battlefield.</p> <h4 id="-suijinheki---water-encampment-wall-">–( Suijinheki - Water Encampment Wall )–</h4> <p>This defensive technique creates a wall of water around you, which forms a violently churning defensive perimeter. When lacking water in the environment to use, a talented shinobi can form it in their stomach and spit it out.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 26 Special: Interrupt, Abort Speed: 12 Seal Speed: 12 Requires: 10+NDB*2 gallons of water</li> </ul> <p>Effects: If using Suijinheki as an interrupt: Make an accuracy roll against an incoming attack, with a bonus of half your ninjutsu damage bonus or this technique’s final, modified Speed, whichever is lower. Once Suijinheki has been deployed, it lasts for your NDB in IC (whether your defense succeeded or failed), stopping any other incoming attacks automatically without having to roll. Anytime after the initial attack, you may Abort this technique, which is necessary if you need to move or attack through it. This technique protects you from any Katon up to A-rank, Doton up to C-rank, and all other techniques (including taijutsu) up to B-rank, and uses up a number of gallons equal to twice the rank of the technique it’s first used against, plus 2 gallons per IC it’s deployed, which are removed from the battlefield thereafter (basic attacks, however, do not have any gallons of water lost in this way).</p> <h4 id="-bakusui-shouha---exploding-water-shockwave-">–( Bakusui Shouha - Exploding Water Shockwave )–</h4> <p>The user creates an enormous amount of water by spewing it from their mouth, flooding the battlefield and potentially crushing foes in its path. Best of all, they get to look awesome while doing it! The wave rises up from beneath the user, and they can ‘ride’ it to its destination.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 18+X</li> <li>Damage: Xd12+X*8</li> <li>Range: 10 + X*2</li> <li>Area: 10 + X*2</li> <li>Special: Stun X</li> <li>Speed: 16</li> <li>Seal Speed: 26</li> </ul> <p>Effects: Adds X*4 gallons of water to the battlefield. X has a maximum of your Chakra Control ranks. This technique travels in a line from you to its target (or its maximum range). You may move a number of yards equal to the final Speed of this attack along that line as part of this technique, unhindered by anything which would normally prevent you from moving. Anyone other than yourself within the area must defend against this technique.</p> <h4 id="-benzaiten-no-jutsu---river-goddess-technique-">–( Benzaiten no Jutsu - River Goddess Technique )–</h4> <p>Named after the deity who supposedly watches over a major river, this technique coats the user’s body with a thin layer of chakra-infused water. It offers no real protection from impacts or weapons, but can be an effective supplement to one’s defenses against heat and other unpleasantness.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 20</li> <li>Upkeep: 4</li> <li>Special: Interrupt</li> <li>Speed: 10</li> <li>Seal Speed: 16</li> <li>Requires: 16 gallons of water</li> </ul> <p>Effects: So long as this is maintained you cannot be affected by Ignite or Burn statuses, and you take 25% less damage from Katon jutsu (applied after other reductions). Activating it will end any ongoing Ignites harmlessly, but will not cure Burns.</p> <h4 id="-suishi-no-jutsu---water-drowning-technique-">–( Suishi no Jutsu - Water Drowning Technique )–</h4> <p>An advanced version of the ever-popular Water Prison Technique, this remedies the greatest flaw in that technique: a lack of lethality. It does… about what it says. In terms of appearances, it’s almost identical to a regular water prison.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 28</li> <li>Upkeep: 8</li> <li>Speed: 18</li> <li>Seal Speed: 20</li> <li>Requires: 24 gallons of water</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This follows all normal rules for the Water Prison Technique, with the following exceptions: The victim suffers from Suffocation 1 every 5 IC regardless of their Chakra Control, and by spending 1 Willpower, they are allowed a 1d20+CHA/10+(5 per Fatigue category) roll against your 1d20+CHA/10+(ninjutsu damage bonus). They also get one such check whenever they advance a Fatigue category inside the prison, and when you first strike them with it. Success means they break free.</p> <h4 id="-uramiame---grudge-rain-">–( Uramiame - Grudge Rain )–</h4> <p>As a weather-manipulation jutsu, this technique is extremely taxing upon its user. Upon its completion a large storm cloud is created, which proceeds to, as storm clouds are prone to do, rain. This rain saps the chakra from anyone it comes in contact with, and transfers it through the pooling water to the technique’s user.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 32</li> <li>Upkeep: 6</li> <li>Area: CHA/2</li> <li>Speed: 20</li> <li>Seal Speed: 20</li> <li>Requires: 32 gallons of water</li> </ul> <p>Effects: Every 10 IC, everyone other than the user and up to (Chakra Control)/5 people they’ve designated as allies has their Chakra Exhaustion penalty increased by 1, and the user has their Chakra Exhaustion penalty decreased by 1 (so long as at least one person had their CE penalty increased). This remains centered on the user as they move.</p> <h2 id="a-rank">A-Rank</h2> <h4 id="-daibakufu---great-waterfall-">–( Daibakufu - Great Waterfall )–</h4> <p>This is one of the most powerful water ninjutsu in existence; once the appropriate seals are formed, the user unleashes a devastating tidal wave which tears across the battlefield like a scaled-down tsunami, knocking aside people, trees, and small buildings in its path. Long ago, exceptionally skilled shinobi were able to fill their impromptu waterfall with all manner of weapons, which were propelled within the wave at incredible speeds. This had the effect of making it an almost unavoidably deadly technique that would leave pools of blood mixed in with the water. However, use of that aspect of the technique was forbidden due to its unbelievable power, and as peace settled across the lands the secret of how to do that was lost.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 42</li> <li>Damage: 24d20+300</li> <li>Range: 80</li> <li>Area: 20 wide, up to max range in length; may be used as a smaller area if you wish</li> <li>Special: Stun 18</li> <li>Speed: 36</li> <li>Seal Speed: 30</li> <li>Requires: 200 gallons of water</li> </ul> <p>Effects: Half the gallons of water used in this technique are removed from the battlefield, scattered as a fine mist over the area; if the gallon requirement is somehow removed, this technique’s Chakra cost is increased by 18. Blocking reduces this technique’s Stun by half.</p> <h4 id="-daikoudan---great-shark-blast-">–( Daikoudan - Great Shark Blast )–</h4> <p>This creates an enormous shark out of water and sends it crashing across the battlefield at whichever party has offended the user sufficiently for them to feel the need to do so. Aside from impacting its primary target, the shark is massive enough to cause significant collateral damage. The technique’s true secret, however, is its ability to absorb any chakra it comes in contact with and use that energy to further empower itself.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 36</li> <li>Damage: 15d20+200</li> <li>Range: 50</li> <li>Area: 16</li> <li>Special: Interrupt</li> <li>Speed: 16</li> <li>Seal Speed: 26</li> <li>Requires: 24 gallons of water + Special</li> </ul> <p>Effects: If used as an Interrupt, you may choose to reduce this technique’s Seal Speed by 10 and increase its Chakra cost by 10. You can choose to use more than the required amount of gallons of water for this technique, adding 2 points of damage per extra gallon used; all gallons of water used in this technique are removed from the battlefield afterward. Used as a normal attack, it does full damage to a single target, and half damage to everyone within its Area.</p> <p>As an Interrupt, it can be used to counter any ranged ninjutsu attack. Daikoudan may be used to Interrupt techniques so long as its Speed is equal to or less than theirs. The two attacks collide, and their damage is compared. For this comparison, treat Katon technqiues as dealing 25% less damage, and Doton as dealing 25% more. If the incoming attack does more damage, you are hit by it, but it has its damage reduced by half. If Daikoudan’s damage is greater, it becomes an attack against the opponent with +5 Accuracy, along with any Accuracy bonuses (but not penalties) of the attack it countered. It does an additional (X)<em>10 damage, where X is the Chakra cost of the move it countered. Similarly, if a ninjutsu-based defense is used against Daikoudan, and fails to stop it completely, it does full damage (bypassing even partial defense) and adds (X)</em>10 damage, with X being the Chakra cost of the failed defense.</p> <h4 id="-dai-bakusui-shouha---great-exploding-water-shockwave-">–( Dai Bakusui Shouha - Great Exploding Water Shockwave )–</h4> <p>A stronger version of the B-rank Exploding Water Shockwave, the user spits out a truly prodigious amount of water.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 30 + X</li> <li>Upkeep: 8</li> <li>Range: 20 + X * 4</li> <li>Area: 20 + X * 4</li> <li>Special: Stun 10 + X</li> <li>Speed: 26</li> <li>Seal Speed: 32</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This adds 200+X*20 gallons of water to the battlefield. X has a maximum of your Chakra Control ranks. Unlike other Suiton techniques, you can use the water from this technique even while maintaining its upkeep. So long as you maintain its Upkeep and there are least 200 gallons of water on the battlefield, any techniques which function by altering the condition of the ground (such as Syrup Capture Field, or Retsudotensho) are effectively useless, as the water forms a flattened orb over the affected area, with the user anchored at its center. The water orb will follow them, and the below effects will be maintained (when the upkeep ends, so do they, as the water disperses over a much larger area): Anyone who can’t stand on water will begin to sink into the orb, and is forced to swim (at half their normal movement speed, unaided by normal movement-increasing techniques), and until they exit the area, they suffer a Suffocation 1 every 10 IC. Someone forced to swim in this way can take a Speed 5 action to keep themselves at the surface of the water, preventing them from gaining any Suffocation status from this technique for 15 IC.</p> <h4 id="-hijutsu-kirisame---secret-technique-mist-rain-">–( Hijutsu: Kirisame - Secret Technique: Mist Rain )–</h4> <p>This technique causes it to start raining over a small (well, for… rain) area. This rain is chakra-infused, and will siphon away any chakra which doesn’t match its own (in other words, its creator’s); fallen rain evaporates rapidly, only to fall again, and shrouds the area in a thick mist.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 36</li> <li>Upkeep: 10</li> <li>Area: CHA</li> <li>Speed: 18</li> <li>Seal Speed: 24</li> <li>Requires: 100 gallons of water</li> </ul> <p>Effects: Any jutsu which is used inside the mist, or includes the mist as any part of its area has its ninjutsu damage bonus reduced by 5, which affects both damage and any and all other calculations based off of NDB (such as improved range and/or area); Katon instead have their NDB reduced by 10. Additionally, this imposes a -8 visibility penalty to everyone in the area. You are immune to the damage reduction and suffer half the normal visibility penalty. If you move, the rain moves with you; due to its massive area and associated visibility penalty, it’s impossible for others to track you by the rain’s movement. This mist is immune to lower-rank effects which would reduce its Visibility Penalty (such as the E-Rank Fuuton Cleansing Winds), but effects which would remove it entirely (such as the A-Rank Fuuton, The North Wind), will, indeed, remove it. If Mist Rain ends because you stop paying the Upkeep, the damage bonus reduction immediately ends, but the visibility penalty will remain for the next 80 IC (as the rain finishes falling), reducing its Severity by 1 per 10 IC. This technique may only be used outside (and anyone inside within its area is immune to its effects).</p> </d-article> <d-appendix> <d-footnote-list></d-footnote-list> <d-citation-list></d-citation-list> </d-appendix> <d-bibliography src="/assets/bibliography/"></d-bibliography> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 Anchorsify .
