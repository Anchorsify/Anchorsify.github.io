 - Uchiha no longer can copy Jutsu and learn them permanently at an XP discount.  Those that have already done so are grandfathered in, and do not need to change any of the XP spent on learning (or copying) any jutsu; they simply receive no XP discount moving forward.  Uchiha can now once again copy jutsu of one rank higher than they could ordinarily learn.
