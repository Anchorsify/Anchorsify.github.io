Becuase of course they’ve had one, but what second breakfast? Elevenses? Luncheon? Afternoon tea? Dinner? Supper?</p> <p>And the answer to that is detailed below.</p> <h2 id="experience">Experience</h2> <h4 id="roleplay">Roleplay</h4> <p>Roleplay is interacting with others while playing as your character. Do note that this does have to be with other people; playing with yourself may be fun, but claiming you should be rewarded for it is just silly.</p> <p>Every half hour of in-character activity awards 2 XP. You must remain reasonably active throughout this. Thus, if you were playing for an hour and a half, but had to take a twenty minute break in the middle for whatever reason, you would get 4 XP, counting only the hour and ten minutes during which you were actually RPing.</p> <p>When in doubt, use common sense.</p> <h4 id="combat">Combat</h4> <p>As highly-trained (well, in theory), supernaturally-powered fighters, ninja can learn a lot from combat, testing their abilities against one another. Most of the time this is (semi-)friendly practice rounds, or spars. Sometimes it’s, well… not.</p> <p>You get 2 XP for every 30 minutes the fight lasts, though you do not accumulate RP XP during that time. Additionally, you may receive bonus XP for your fight depending on how things went. Consult the lists below!</p> <p>Bonuses:</p> <ul> <li>+1 per Fatigue level you advance during the fight, to a maximum of +5.</li> <li>+2 for every Major wound you acquire.</li> <li>+4 for every Severe wound you acquire.</li> <li>+6 for every Critical wound you acquire.</li> </ul> <p>Penalties:<br> -2 per Fatigue level you begin the battle and -1 per Wound (regardless of level) you start the battle with.</p> <p>After fighting someone, you may not gain XP for fighting that person for 20 hours. If are in a spar with them and other people (who you haven’t fought in the past 20 hours) you still gain XP, however. Wounds acquired from Genjutsu which are not real, and fade after the fight is over, do not grant XP.</p> <h4 id="events">Events</h4> <p>Although the game revolves around the PCs, the world they’re in does not. Things are constantly going on off-screen, separate from casual role playing. Sometimes, GMs will make this known through an event.</p> <p>These are often missions which the characters are sent on by their village, with clearly defined objectives such as delivering an item or protecting a person. However, this is by no means the only type of event.</p> <p>You do not get XP for RPing during events, nor do you get XP for any combat which takes place as part of one. Instead, the GM who ran the event will tell you how much XP you have earned.</p> <h4 id="training">Training</h4> <p>It’s assumed that your ninja keeps themselves busy somehow when off-screen. Maybe they’re doing missions for their village, maybe they actually training, or maybe they’re just laying in a hospital bed reflecting on their mistakes. Realistically, however, you’re not going to go over all these things when playing the game; after all, your character is always a ninja, but you have a real life to worry about.</p> <p>Whatever the reason, your character gets a small amount of XP for each day the game’s been going, representing this; with the way this works, it also helps characters made later in the game catch up.</p> <p>Because it can get a bit convoluted (but look on the bright side: free XP!) this has its own node; check “Training”, for details.</p> <h4 id="other">Other</h4> <p>You may get XP in some other fashion. Usually, this will involve a GM telling you how much you got, and for what reason.</p> <h2 id="spending-experience-points">Spending Experience Points</h2> <h4 id="attributes">Attributes</h4> <p>XP can be spent to increase any of your five basic attributes. Starting out, the cost to do this is 4 XP per 1 point in any single attribute.</p> <p>The primary restriction on this is the poorly-named ‘rule of 3’. What this means is: the amount you have increased an attribute may not be more than 3 points higher than the next highest amount you have increased an attribute by.</p> <p>Because an example will make it clearer: You could raise your STR by 3 points (for 12 XP). To raise it to 4 points, a single other attribute would need to have been raised by at least 1, for a total of (4+1)*4 = 20 XP.</p> <p>Say you had raised your STR and RES by 12 each, your CHA by 9, your AGI by 6, and your DEX by 3. You could raise your STR or your RES to 15 right away, but to raise both of them to 13 you’d need to raise your DEX, AGI, and CHA by 1 each (in that order).</p> <p>And, to be clear, only the amount you have raised an attribute by using XP matters; its starting value, or bonuses from uniques (or any other sources), is not part of this limit.</p> <p>Aside from that restriction, raising attributes summons from a degree of diminishing returns. The first 50 points in an attribute cost, as stated, 4 XP; the next 50 cost 5 XP per +1, the next 50 cost 6 XP per +1, and so forth. Thus, to raise your STR by 62 points you would have to spend a total of (504 + 125) = 260 XP… not counting what you’d have to spend on other attributes to satisfy the ‘rule of 3’.</p> <p>Finally, you may spend no more than half your total XP on stats. So, if you had 1000 XP, you could spend no more 500 XP on raising your stat points.</p> <h4 id="abilities">Abilities</h4> <p>The full details of spending XP to learn abilities are discussed in Chapter 4. But, in brief: it varies from one ability to another, with the costs being listed in individual abilities.</p> <h4 id="jutsu">Jutsu</h4> <p>A ninja who intends to be successful would do well to have a wide variety of techniques at their disposal. The actual restrictions on what you can and can’t learn are discussed in detail in Chapter 6. Once you meet the requirements to acquire a jutsu you want, to learn (or ‘purchase’) it you spend an amount of XP determined by its rank, as listed… below:</p> <ul> <li>E: 4</li> <li>D: 6</li> <li>C: 9</li> <li>B: 18</li> <li>A: 36</li> </ul> <h4 id="other-1">Other</h4> <p>Anything else you can spend XP on will likely explain the rules for doing so in its description.</p> <h4 id="experience-bonuses">Experience Bonuses</h4> <p>Clanless characters, and certain clans (which will say so in their description), get what is called an experience bonus. This is an amount beyond your Total XP which you can spend.</p> <p>Experience Bonuses are given in percents–for example, Clanless characters have a 10% XP Bonus. Take, for example, a clanless character who’s earned 100 XP from RP, 100 from fighting, and 23 from events, on top of his starting 100 XP. This means that his Total XP is 323, just like any normal character.</p> <p>However, he also has a 10% XP bonus; this means that his bonus XP is 32. Thus, in his Spent XP log (you’ll read more about logs later in this chapter) he would record XP Total as 323, “XP Bonus (%)” as 32 (and change the % to 10%), and “Total + Bonus” as (323+32) 355.</p> <p>Your total amount of XP spent can go up to your Total + Bonus.</p> <p>However, your bonus is not actually part of your Total XP. Many things are based on your Total XP, such as bonuses to Genjutsu rolls, your Skill Points, and Talents. XP bonuses have no effect on these.</p> <h2 id="training-1">Training</h2> <h4 id="late-creation">Late Creation</h4> <p>Because of this game’s constantly-ongoing nature, a lot of people will join after it starts; also, you might get tired of a character and make a new one. Training gives 8 XP a day since the beginning of the Restart. every day a character exists (see “Normal Training” below), which would leave this people at a disadvantage. For example, if you join 100 days into the game, everyone would have 1000 XP more than you.</p> <p>As such, someone joining late or recreating gets most of this amount as a lump sum – to be exact, 80% of it (that’s 8 per day after game start), on top of the normal quantity based on their choice of start from the list in Chapter 1 (100, 1000, or 1500). Due to the presence of an overall XP cap, the difference should not be too hard to make up, and exists to reward people who stick with their character from the start; moreover, it is significantly more generous to late starters or recreaters than past iterations have been.</p> <h4 id="normal-training">Normal Training</h4> <p>As mentioned above, you get 8 XP for every day your character exists. You do not, however, need to buy a calendar just for this game! As long as you put your character creation date in properly on the sheet (cell S8 on The Log tab), the sheet is properly equipped to automatically calculate your Training XP.</p> <h4 id="village-status">Village Status</h4> <ul> <li> <ol> <li>Academy Student</li> </ol> </li> <li> <ol> <li>Genin</li> </ol> </li> <li> <ol> <li>Chuunin</li> </ol> </li> <li> <ol> <li>Jounin</li> </ol> </li> <li> <ol> <li>Special Jounin</li> </ol> </li> <li> <ol> <li>ANBU</li> </ol> </li> <li> <ol> <li>Missing Nin</li> </ol> </li> <li> <ol> <li>Sennin</li> </ol> </li> <li> <ol> <li>Kage</li> </ol> </li> </ul> <p>No matter what ranks or combination of ranks you obtain, you may only acquire a total of 4 Unique Points from ranking up. Thus, if you were promoted to Chuunin, then to Special Jounin, and later transferred to full Jounin status, you would have 2+1+2 = 5 -&gt; +4 UP from your rank.</p> <h4 id="academy-student">Academy Student</h4> <p>Every ninja village has its own ninja academy. It’s a lot like you might expect a modern grade school to be, except instead of learning math the students learn how to mold chakra, and instead of mandatory sports programs there are mandatory mock battles.</p> <p>The ethics of training children of single-digit ages to be effective killing machines is dubious at best; however, it’s been shown that shinobi who begin training from a young age (younger than 10, older than 6, is the typical rule of thumb; any younger and they risk stunting their development) have significantly higher potential than those who begin later.</p> <p>Players do not begin as academy students, though it’s presumed that their character was one beforehand, and only recently graduated. The rank is included here for the sake of completion.</p> <h4 id="genin">Genin</h4> <p>After graduating from their village’s Ninja Academy students are promoted to the rank of Genin. This is when they’re given a forehead protector with their village’s emblem, worn to identify them as ninja. They’re also entered into their village’s Ninja Registry for identification purposes.</p> <p>At the rank of Genin they will finally begin performing actual missions for the village, usually of E- and D-rank, though sometimes higher with supervision. Genin are trusted to go on missions outside of their village.</p> <p>While genin are typically the weakest ninja in their village, it’s a rank, not a measurement of power. It’s quite possible for a genin to be more powerful than their superiors.</p> <p>Genin can learn E-rank Taijutsu and Ninjutsu techniques.</p> <h4 id="chuunin">Chuunin</h4> <p>Chuunin are shinobi who have proven themselves capable leaders within their village, able to coordinate effective strategies during missions and make intelligent decisions for themselves and others, and make up the bulk of the village’s combat-ready forces.</p> <p>The villages organize a semi-annual Chuunin Exam, with candidates from all villages participating. This is used both for the ninja involved to prove their worthiness of advancement, but also as a way for the village to show off the talents of their shinobi; Chuunin Exams are relatively public affairs, with many nobles and potential employers attending.</p> <p>While rare, at times exceptional shinobi will demonstrate their ability consistently in missions and other situations, and the village will choose to promote them without waiting for them to pass the Chuunin Exams.</p> <p>Chuunin are all issued, and most choose to wear, special flak jackets when they’re promoted. These identify them as qualified as shinobi, and for many ninja wearing one is point of pride. Some opt not to, instead preferring more distinct robes or capes.</p> <p>Promotion Requirements: Be able to use D-rank Taijutsu and Ninjutsu. Pass the Chuunin Exams.</p> <p>Chuunin have access to C-rank taijutsu and ninjutsu techniques. Upon promotion to Chuunin, you gain 2 Unique Points.</p> <h4 id="jounin">Jounin</h4> <p>Considered the elite ninja of the village, Jounin are ninja who prove themselves exceptionally capable shinobi. Jounin Exams do exist, but they are not as public or prestigious as Chuunin exams, which are meant to be a show to the country’s daimyo of that village’s potential. They are sent on high-priority A- and S-rank missions, regularly dealing with life-threatening situations.</p> <p>Jounin are often given squads of Genin to lead, training the next generation as they had once done for them. While it varies between villages just how important this process is, usuually a genin’s sensei is a lasting confidante and, at times, someone to measure themselves against.</p> <p>Promotion Requirements: Be a Chuunin. Never inflict a critical on a fellow village shinobi during training. Be able to use D-rank Genjutsu. Pass a Jounin exam or be selected for advancement.</p> <p>Jounin have access to B-rank techniques. When you’re promoted to Jounin to receive 2 Unique Points, and may choose two of the following rank benefits.</p> <h4 id="special-jounin">Special Jounin</h4> <p>Special jounin occupy distinguished positions in their village; Genin and Chuunin typically think the rank is ‘below’ jounin, while most jounin respect a special jounin’s expertise.</p> <p>Every special jounin has one field in which they excel. When someone thinks of a special jounin they typically imagine interrogators, trackers, and med nin, though many work behind the scenes as strategists and administrators (a few of them even have fearsome custom administrative ninjutsu techniques).</p> <p>Sometimes Jounin are promoted laterally to Special Jounin status; similarly, ANBU may temporarily or permanently ‘retire’ due to the psychological stress of their work, and become Special Jounin so that the village can still use their talents. It’s even possible for Chuunin to be promoted directly for Special Jounin status, if their skills are valuable enough but their overall performance doesn’t merit Jounin status.</p> <p>Promotion Requirements:</p> <p>Be selected based on your specialized skills. Already be Chuunin or higher rank. Special Jounin have access to C-rank techniques.</p> <p>Additionally, for a single category (such as Medical Ninjutsu) they have access to B- and A-ranked techniques. Upon promotion, Special Jounin receive 1 additional Unique Point to spend.</p> <h4 id="anbu">ANBU</h4> <p>The black ops division of every village, ANBU (Ansatsu Senjutsu Tokushu Butai) are the most elite, competent, and ruthless of their peers. They serve as the Kage’s bodyguards, and are entrusted with the most sensitive missions. ANBU identify themselves (or, rather, hide their identities) by wearing a unique face mask, white with a pattern in some secondary color to make the mask resemble some type of animal.</p> <p>In terms of skill and power, ANBU are comparable to jounin. The difference is the kind of missions they are assigned. ANBU are promoted with personal approval from the Kage, and are among the most loyal and dedicated shinobi of their village.</p> <p>They’re also the ones most likely to be sent on high-profile infiltration and assassination missions. Being ANBU is a mixed blessing: they don’t really have any more authority within their own village, and while they are respected by their peers there’s also a certain stigma attached to ANBU.</p> <p>Promotion Requirements:</p> <p>Be a REAL Ninja.</p> <p>ANBU have access to B-rank jutsu, and access to A-rank jutsu of a single category (such as Combo Taijutsu). ANBU members receive 1 Unique Point.</p> <h4 id="missing-nin">Missing Nin</h4> <p>Not actually a rank, but rather a status. This is the term applied to ninja who have deserted their village (“gone missing”) for one reason or another. Missing nin are, in simplest terms, traitors. Most villages will, once they realize one of their ninja has fled, promptly add that person to their Bingo Books and, if the reason they left was sufficiently severe, or if they knew village secrets, dispatch ANBU teams to hunt them down and either bring them back to the village or kill them.</p> <p>Some missing nin may defect to other villages. However, even if they’re allowed to (many villages will accept, and then promptly imprison the traitor) they are generally treated poorly and disrespected–once a traitor, always a traitor, and in the shinobi world loyalty is one of the most valuable traits a person can have.</p> <p>Requirements: Desert your village. Harder than it sounds…</p> <p>Rank benefits: So, I’ve got good news, and I’ve got bad news…</p> <p>The good news: You’re your own boss! Nobody can tell you what to do!</p> <p>The bad news: Your village wants you dead or captured, and everyone else wants the bounty your village put on your head.</p> <h4 id="sennin">Sennin</h4> <p>Calling this a rank is dubious, at best. Certainly, it’s not an official one. These are ninja who’ve reached a great level of distinction in their village for reasons other than power in combat, but who are also skilled enough to be more than a match for most other ninja in battle.</p> <p>Most sennin serve as personal advisors to the kage, and potential stand-ins for the kage; many sennin would be suitable kages (though perhaps not powerful enough, yet), if not for personal issues, such as aversion to authority or a strong preference for field work.</p> <p>Sennin are often give free reign to leave their village and undertake long-term personal missions–one of the defining characteristics of them is that they’re implicitly trusted by their village to such an extent.</p> <p>Rank benefits:</p> <p>You can come and go from your village as you please, without being labelled as a missing nin. However, you’re still expected to answer to the Kage, and not to act against your village’s interests.</p> <h4 id="kage">Kage</h4> <p>The highest rank attainable in any of the major shinobi villages is that of Kage: the lead ninja in the village. Officially, only the leaders of the Five Great Ninja Villages are recognized as Kages: Raikage (Cloud), Hokage (Leaf), Mizukage (Mist), Kazekage (Sand), and Tsuchikage (Stone). The leaders of Otogakure have taken to styling themselves as the Otokages, though they are not officially realized as such.</p> <p>A village’s Kage is not an autocrat; they are still accountable to their village’s ruling council. However, the Kage is also more than a figurehead. They are one of the village’s most powerful shinobi, but also one who knows when to listen to others and respect the needs of their people.</p> <p>Though most Genin entertain dreams of one day becoming their respective village’s Kage, they generally manage to outgrow those desires. Being Kage is hard work, and typically painfully dull to the ones capable of doing it well (many Kages have infamously short tempers for paperwork).</p> <p>A Kage can either be appointed as successor by their predecessor, or nominated by the village council. Once they’ve taken the position, a Kage technically holds the title for life; most step down in their later years and let a younger shinobi take over, remaining Kage in name only.</p> </d-article> <d-appendix> <d-footnote-list></d-footnote-list> <d-citation-list></d-citation-list> </d-appendix> <d-bibliography src="/assets/bibliography/"></d-bibliography> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 Anchorsify .
