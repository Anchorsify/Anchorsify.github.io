## D-rank
#### --( Rendan - Combo )--
Not so much a proper technique as a catch-all term for any series of attacks made in rapid succession, without breaking one's flow or allowing an opponent time to retreat.

- Stamina: 12
- Damage: Basic Unarmed Attack + 1d6
- Speed: 10
- Combo Counter: +1d6 damage, -1 Speed

#### --( Yaburi Yashi - Smashing Palm )--
A single, staggeringly powerful open-palmed blow delivered at the end of a combo, aimed at the opponent's midsection to strike their solar plexus.

- Stamina: 16
- Damage: Basic Unarmed Attack + 3d*
- Speed: 15
- Special: Finisher
- Combo Bonus: +2 Stun

Effects: This is an automatic called shot to the abdomen. If it's blocked, the Stun is halved.

#### --( Gekido Denka - Furious Charge )--
The basis of combos in battle is maintaining one's momentum, striking one blow before the opponent's fully recovered from the one before it. In many cases, all one needs is a few seconds to get away from their opponent and catch their breath to escape an otherwise merciless beating. You, however, just love to beat people mercilessly. Though it's taxing, you can keep your adrenaline up, and keep your blows coming rapidly and rhythmically, even after being forced to chase after your victims.

- Stamina: 15
- Upkeep: 1
- Speed: 6
- Tags: Preparation

Effects: So long as you maintain Furious Charge, taking Move actions will not break your combos. Using movement based jutsu (such as Shunshin), however, will.

## C-Rank
#### --( Line of Attack )--
You use ninja wire and momentum to fly across the battlefield at amazing speeds and prevent your opponent from escaping your offensive.

- Stamina: 12
- Speed: 9
- Damage: Basic Unarmed Attack
- Special: Opener
- Requires: X yards of Ninja Wire

Effects: You attach ninja wire to your target as you strike, slowing their movement if they try to escape your follow-up attacks. X has a maximum of 20. Your target takes a -5% movement speed penalty, which is increased by 5 per two yards of ninja wire below the maximum used; thus, if you used 14 yards of ninja wire, they would be at -20% movement speed for the duration of the combo. Until your combo ends, you receive +10% movement speed per Combo Counter whenever moving (on its own, or as part of an attack) toward the bound character, to a maximum of +10% per two yards of ninja wire used. If your opponent ever manages to get further away than X*2 yards, the combo immediately ends.

Alternatively, someone bound can attempt to make a called shot to cut the wire with any slashing attack; you can choose to defend (you can not 'parry' with the wire, but can wiggle the wire to make it 'dodge') to keep the wire attached, or simply let them cut it. If hit the wire is hit, the connection is broken. Cutting the wire doesn't end the combo, only this opener's effects.

#### --( Shishi Rendan - Lion Combo )--
Ideally meant to be used after performing Kage Buyo, this is a series of high-speed punches and kicks.

- Stamina: 18
- Damage: Basic Unarmed Attack + 2d8
- Speed: 10
- Combo Counter: +1 Accuracy, -1 Speed

#### --( Reikoku Kagai - Relentless Assault )--
You get in close to your opponent and begin beating on them! Doing so for a prolonged period of time can easily overwhelm all but the strongest defenses.

- Stamina: 16
- Damage: Base Unarmed Attack + 4d8
- Accuracy: -3
- Speed: 8
- Combo Counter: Blocking is 5% less effective, +10 damage

#### --( Shishi Danmaku - Lion Barrage )--
A popular way to end the similarly-named combo-assault, the Lion Barrage was is often taught to students along with Lion Combo itself. Advanced taijutsu users, however, have been known to appreciate the flexibility and fluidity that comes from separating the techniques. The Lion Barrage is simply a series of fast, strong fist and knee strikes.

- Stamina: 25
- Damage: Basic Unarmed Attack + 6d*
- Accuracy: +4
- Speed: 14
- Special: Finisher
- Combos Bonus: +2d*

#### --( Hangeki Rendan - Counter Combo )--
Exploiting a momentary break in your opponent's attacks, you turn the tables on them! It's very exciting, and stuff.

- Stamina: 20
- Speed: 8

Effects: You and your opponent both make Accuracy rolls. If your result is higher, you immediately break their combo and can execute any Opener you know as an Interrupt, with a starting Combo Counter equal to whatever your opponent's was when you used this technique. If you fail, your opponent may immediately use any combo they know against you as an Interrupt.

#### --( Rakurai Heishi - Lightning Warrior )--
Conventional wisdom says that one must prioritize speed or power, having to choose between one or the other. You reject that, striking both quickly and decisively. Of course, that means you have to pay the price elsewhere: fighting like this will rapidly wear a person out.

- Stamina: 12
- Upkeep: 0
- Speed: 6
- Tags: Preparation

Effects: While Rakurai Heishi is maintained, any time a combo you are performing would be broken you may choose to increase this technique's Upkeep by 2; when you do so, your combo is not broken. If your combo is broken, Lightning Warrior's Upkeep is reset to 0. If you stop maintaining Lightning Warrior, your current combo is automatically broken. Rakurai Heishi cannot be used if your combo is broken because you performed a Finisher or a Move action.

#### --( Bunka-ken - Splintering Fist )--
A powerful blow that smashes through defenses. Your attack carries almost concussive force behind it, enough to overcome all but the most resilient of enemies.

- Stamina: +11
- Speed: +6
- Damage: Basic Unarmed Attack, Maximized
- Special: Finisher
- Combo Bonus: Ignore 10 points of DR, enemy takes +2 damage from all attacks for the rest of the battle

Effects: This is applied as an addition to a Basic Unarmed Attack, increasing its Stamina and Speed accordingly and turning it into a Finisher. The 'd' in the damage calculation is replaced with '*', dealing the maximum possible damage rather than rolling. The lasting bonus damage from this technique is applied after all reductions (and after the Scorched Chest energy wound, if the opponent has it), but before determining if wounds are suffered from the attack. Multiple Splintering Fists on the same target stack the bonus damage normally.

## B-Rank
#### --( Hasu Rendan - Lotus Combo )--
The user of this technique launches into a sequence of strikes designed to alternately wind, disorient, and daze their opponent, combining those effects to prevent their adversary from fighting back effectively for as long as possible.

- Stamina: 10
- Damage: Basic Unarmed Attack + 2d10
- Speed: 4
- Special: Opener. This action's Speed may not be reduced.
- Combo Counter: +2d10 damage, +2 Stamina, +1 Accuracy

Effects: Each time this technique is used consecutively (with no other non-interrupt actions between uses), its base Speed increases by 2, its Stamina increases by 4, and it gives an additional 1 Combo Counter. This stacks; the fourth Lotus in a sequence would be Speed (4 + 2 * 3) 10, give (1 + 1 * 3) 4 Combo Counters, and have a Stamina cost of 22 (before Cadence effects). Additionally, Lotus Combo can extend existing stuns: If a target hit by Lotus Combo is Stunned, the duration of that Stun is increased by X * 2, with X being the length of the current Lotus sequence. Thus, hitting someone with four Lotus Combos in a row would extend their stun by (2+4+6+8) 20.

#### --( Hokuto no Ken - Fist of the North Star )--
Delivering a precise, rapid, and powerful series of blows to vital points on an opponent's body, this causes their blood vessels to spontaneously rupture, resulting in both internal hemorrhaging and dramatic external bleeding, sometimes even resulting in a brief spray of blood immediately after its use.

- Stamina: 28
- Damage: Basic Unarmed Attack + 9d*
- Accuracy: +2
- Speed: 20
- Special: Finisher
- Combo Bonus: +1d* damage to Base Attack, +2 Bleed

Effects: Even if Hokuto no Ken is parried, it still inflicts its Bleed.

#### --( Aragami no Jutsu - God of Battle Technique )--
Rather than waiting for your opponents to give you openings and then capitalizing upon them, you make openings. When that doesn't work, you break through your opponent's defenses anyway, attacking even when it seems fruitless, until finally something gives.

- Stamina: 20
- Upkeep: 0
- Speed: 6
- Tags: Preparation

Effects: Whenever you hit with a technique that raises your Combo Counter, your Combo Counter increases by 1 more, and Aragami's Upkeep also increases by 2. When your combo is broken, Aragami's Upkeep is reset to 0. If you end Aragami, your Combo Counter is immediately set to 0.

#### --( Mouretsu Tora no Jutsu - Furious Tiger Technique )--
You break off your combo with an abrupt transition back into more traditional taijutsu techniques, taking advantages of the momentum and rhythm you've built up to deliver one devastating blow.

- Stamina: +10
- Speed: +6
- Special: Finisher
- Combo Bonus: +0.5 Accuracy, +5% damage

Effects: This finisher is used by combining it with any Unarmed Taijutsu technique, increasing its Stamina cost appropriately. The Combo Bonuses are applied to that technique, modifying it appropriately.

## A-Rank
#### --( Akuma no Isoi - Devil's Rush )--
A technique that requires extreme speed and toughness, and a considerable disregard for one's own health. Most shinobi learn first-hand in the academy what 'chakra burns' are: burns, typically found on the hands (where chakra is typically focused), caused by poorly forcing too much of one's chakra through their body's "chakra pores". This technique takes a common mistake among academy students and weaponizes it, forcibly overwhelming one's own chakra circulatory system in the arms and hands, superheating their body. That, combined with the high-speed blows delivered by this technique, results in what appear to be literally flaming punches. This can actually be delivered in kicks as well, and the general consensus is that a 'burning' leg is more visually impressive. Most ninja, however, prefer punches, because they hate fun.

- Stamina: 20
- Damage: Basic Unarmed Attack + 6d6.open(6)
- Speed: 10
- Combo Counter: +2d6 damage, +2 Ignite

Effects: If you hit, your target rolls Resistance against your Athletics. On a success, the severity of the Ignite is halved. You suffer Burns with a severity equal to the Ignite you inflict.

#### --( Taiyou Douyou no Jutsu - Solar Agitation Technique )--
For once, the name actually has a basis in reality! This technique is a single, devastating blow to the opponent's solar plexus, knocking the wind from their lungs and temporarily debilitating them in the aftermath.

- Stamina: 30
- Damage: Basic Unarmed Attack + 10d20
- Accuracy: +2
- Speed: 18
- Special: Finisher
- Combo Bonus: +3 Stun, +1 to target's Stamina penalty, +1d20 damage

Effects: This has an additional feature if used against an opponent who was performing handseals: If the total Stun from Solar Agitation is greater than the Speed of their Perform Handseals action, the victim automatically Aborts their Perform Handseals action (as if they had failed the Chakra Control roll against the attack's damage dealt), and must make a Chakra Exhaustion roll against the technique aborted.

#### --( Senkagami no Jutsu - God of War Technique )--
The greatest of hand-to-hand combatants are able to dispatch enemies one after another in the midst of battle, their momentum never lagging, their blows not showing the slightest hint of hesitation.
If you've mastered this technique, you are officially one of them! Congratulations!

- Stamina: +5
- Upkeep: 0
- Speed: +0

Effects: This is used alongside a Finisher. Using that Finisher does not end your combo; instead, your Combo Counter is halved, but you may continue your combo, make another finisher, or so forth. If your Finisher missed and you activated Senkagami, your Combo Counter does not decrease at all. After using a finisher with Senkagami applied, you gain an Upkeep of 5 from Senkagami; each subsequent use increases Senkagami's Upkeep by 5 (10 after the second use, 15 after the third, and so forth). When your combo is broken, Senkagami's Upkeep ends; similarly, if you end Senkagami's Upkeep, your combo ends automatically.
