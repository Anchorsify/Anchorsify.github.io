## E-Rank
#### --( Hinotama no Jutsu - Fireball Technique )--
This jutsu is considered a training exercise among academy students who're quick to grasp the basics of katon jutsu, but is easy to create and can be fired quickly. After performing the handseals the user focuses chakra in their hand and projects it into a fist-sized ball of fire, which they can then shoot at a target.

 - Chakra: 8
 - Damage: 4d6.extra(4)
 - Accuracy: +1
 - Range: 10
 - Speed: 6
 - Seal Speed: 5
 - Tags: Energy, Projectile

#### --( Asayake no Jutsu - Morning Glow Technique )--
In addition to being good practice for chakra control, many fire-using ninja find it useful when left without supplies. It creates a small, warm ball of fire that hovers around its user's palm, over their fingertips, or so forth. This ball is not hot enough to ignite, well, anything, but it's particularly bright for its size.

 - Chakra: 5
 - Upkeep: 2
 - Area: 10 + CHA/10
 - Speed: 6
 - Seal Speed: 4
 - Tags: Environmental

Effects: The orb sheds light equivalent to a small oil lamp. This reduces darkness-based visibility effects by 4, and any Environmental Visibility Penalties by 2; multiple instances of this technique do not stack either effect.

#### --( Enmaku no Jutsu - Smokescreen Technique )--
A low-level technique which sees some use even by more experienced ninja, in certain situations. It causes a Katon jutsu to release a prodigious amount of smoke before it burns out, reducing visibility over an area.

 - Chakra: +2, +1 per rank above E
 - Area: 3, +3 per rank above E
 - Seal Speed: +3
 - Tags: Environmental

Effects: This technique is used in combination with a damage-dealing Katon jutsu, increasing its Seal Speed and Chakra cost accordingly. The resulting smokescreen has a duration of 10 IC, +5 IC per rank above E. Within this area, the smoke imposes a -2 visibility penalty, increasing by one per rank above E the jutsu Enmaku was used with is. This technique can also be used on its own, using a person suffering from the Ignite status as its source; in this case it's Chakra 6, Speed 5, and Seal Speed 3. Every 2 points of Ignite is equivalent to one jutsu rank (so "rank D", meaning -3 visibility, at Ignite 4).

## D-Rank
#### --( Houenka - Flame Flower )--
After completing the handseals, the user creates three balls of fire-elemented chakra: one in each palm, and one in their mouth, all three of which can be fired separately or focused on a single target.

 - Chakra: 13
 - Damage: 6d6.extra(6), Special
 - Range: 15
 - Speed: 12
 - Seal Speed: 7
 - Tags: Energy, Projectile

Effects: This technique hits up to three separate targets, and has a +2 bonus to accuracy. For each fireball beyond the first directed at the same target, the damage they take is increased by 3d6, and the technique has +1 accuracy.

#### --( Shitai Entou - Flame Tongue )--
Originally thought to be a technique that required a prolonged diet of special, possibly chakra-enhanced chemicals, this was later discovered to be actually a fairly simple Katon jutsu. The user breathes out a thick, nearly solid stream of fire from their mouth--typically at another person, whom they would like to injure.

 - Chakra: 16
 - Damage: 14d8.extra(7)
 - Range: 10
 - Speed: 10
 - Seal Speed: 8
 - Status: Burns 5
 - Tags: Energy, Projectile

#### --( Enkounebai no Jutsu - Sticky Fire Technique )--
You spit out a mass of chakra-infused saliva; it's clear, odorless, extremely sticky, very flammable, and kind of gross to get hit by.

 - Chakra: 8
 - Range: 10
 - Speed: 8
 - Seal Speed: 6
 - Tags: Projectile

Effects: Your opponent is covered in the flammable saliva. If they are hit by a damage-dealing Katon technique, the saliva ignites, applying an Ignite 5 effect to the unfortunate victim. The severity of this effect is increased by 2 for each rank the jutsu is above E (7 for a D-rank jutsu, 9 for a C-rank, and so forth).

Sticky Fire does not interact with, and can not be set off by or used to set off, any environmental effects (though the Ignite which it creates when set off certainly can).

#### --( Nenshou Yari no Jutsu - Burning Spear Technique )--
This jutsu creates a polearm out of pure flame, which the user can hold unharmed (and without lighting their clothes on fire). Konoha once tried to have a treaty passed to ban the use of this technique, though nobody else quite understands what all the fuss is about.

 - Chakra: 14
 - Upkeep: 2
 - Speed: 8
 - Seal Speed: 12
 - Status: Ignite 4
 - Tags: Nintaijutsu, Preparation

Effects: You acquire a naginata or yari made out of fire. It uses your NDB +33% instead of your PDB for its damage. Whenever someone is struck by it, they suffer Burns 2. You may perform handseals while holding this weapon, but doing so increases the Seal Speed by 6. The weapon persists until you let go of it.

#### --( Houyoku - Phoenix Wings )--
This technique wreathes part of your body--generally a forearm and hand, but it can vary depending on the needs of the technique--with chakra-based flames! It's quite flashy, and could be considered low-grade nintaijutsu, as it then combined those flames with a physical attack of your choice.

 - Chakra: +8
 - Seal Speed: +5
 - Status: Burns 4
 - Tags: Nintaijutsu

Effects: After completing the seals, you perform any non-grapple unarmed attack. The technique uses your ninjutsu, rather than physical damage bonus, and increases it by 25%, unless the technique itself increases it further in which case, you use whichever is preferable.

#### --( Ryuuseiu no Jutsu - Meteor Shower Technique )--
The user gathers intense fire chakra in their palms or fingertips before throwing several weapons which ignite in mid-air. Aside from being painful, being hit by flaming bits of metal carries other risks.

 - Chakra: +(8 + X/2)
 - Speed: +X/4
 - Seal Speed: X
 - Status: Burns (lower of NDB or X)
 - Tags: Nintaijutsu, Projectile

Effects: This technique acts as a link to a multithrow attack, with X being the number of weapons thrown. The weapons used in this technique are ruined by the intense heat, and can not be retrieved or reused.


## C-Rank
#### --( Housenka no Jutsu - Phoenix Sage Fire Technique )--
After performing the handseals, the user exhales a cluster of small fireballs, each concealing one or more shuriken.

 - Chakra: +(12 + X)
 - Damage: +Xd6
 - Speed: +X/2
 - Seal Speed: 4+X
 - Status: Ignite (lower of NDB or X)
 - Tags: Nintaijutsu, Projectile

Effects: This technique acts as a link to a multithrow attack, with X being the number of weapons thrown. The weapons used in this technique are ruined by the intense heat, and can not be retrieved or reused.

#### --( Goukyaku no Jutsu - Grand Fireball Technique )--
Generations ago, this technique was passed down from father to son within the Uchiha clan as an informal, but sometimes very serious, rite of passage. As time passed its use spread first to other Konoha ninja, and then much further.

 - Chakra: 20
 - Damage: 15d12.extra(9)
 - Range: 30
 - Area: 10
 - Speed: 14
 - Seal Speed: 10
 - Status: Burns 6
 - Tags: Area of Effect, Energy, Projectile

#### --( Ryuuka no Jutsu - Dragon Fire Technique )--
This jutsu is painfully slow and inaccurate, making its usefulness situational at best. Most users of the technique find some way to bind or disable their opponents before trying to attack with it. On the other hand, if it manages to connect it can be astonishingly devastating.

- Chakra: 25
- Damage: 12d20.extra(11)
- Accuracy: -8
- Range: 25
- Speed: 20
- Seal Speed: 16
- Special: Burns 4, Ignite 8
- Tags: Energy, Projectile

Effects: This technique benefits from double the user's ninjutsu damage bonus. If you hit, you inflict Burns 4 and Ignite 8, and the target makes a status roll: On a failure, the Burns and Ignite are both doubled.

#### --( Kasumi Enbu no Jutsu - Mist Blaze Dance Technique )--
Once you perform the handseals, this jutsu allows you to exhale a slightly translucent cloud of potentially flammable gas. Even so much as a spark will spell trouble for anyone unfortunate enough to be within it. As an added effect, the glass is ever-so-slightly toxic.

 - Chakra: 14
 - Damage: 6d10.open(6)
 - Area: 20
 - Range: 20
 - Speed: 8
 - Seal Speed: 10
 - Tags: Area of Effect, Energy, Environmental

Effects: This technique initially does no damage. However, it detonates and does the listed damage using half your NDB, across the listed area, if a non-environmental damage dealing Katon jutsu (which isn't itself) contacts its area, or if a person with an Ignite status of 5 or higher is present within it. This explosion cannot be defended against (though the effect which triggered it, if an attack, can still be). The gas is also particularly thick, and not particularly breathable: Every 10 IC that someone spends in the cloud adds a Suffocation 1 status to them. A person is never considered to be affected by more than one Mist Blaze Dance, even if the areas of the techniques overlap. If hit by the technique which sets of this technique while within its area, you combine the two damage rolls together as a single damage for determining wounds.

If this technique is placed in an area where it immediately detonates on the same IC in which it is used, it can be dodged normally as an Area of Effect attack of its normal size and speed, even if it is detonated immediately by a person with an Ignite status setting it off.  

#### --( Yoen no Jutsu - Ember-Burning Technique )--
One of the few katon jutsu which lacks offensive applications, this technique's rank comes from the precision necessary to perform it without lighting oneself on fire. It literally burns dirt, grime, sweat, and contaminants from the target's clothes and body (without, notably, causing either to go up in flames themselves). It can also be used to sterilize (or, if necessary, cauterize) wounds by tracing them with one's fingertips.

 - Chakra: 16
 - Speed: 10
 - Seal Speed: 12

Effects: Removes all foreign particles and bodies (bugs, chemicals) from the user's clothes and body, stops any ongoing bleeding (ending the status), evaporates any liquids covering them (exception: this will ignite the D-rank Sticky Fire Technique and set off Mist Blaze Dance) and ends most external immobilization penalties which apply to you, rather than an area (such as Clay Bullet), though its heat is not extreme enough to melt metal restraints (such as those from Attached Meteor). It can even remove recently spilled, not-yet-dried liquids (including blood!) from clothing. It will not, however, cure poison. This provides a -10 penalty on any attempts to track the user by scent (i.e. Survival rolls), but only a -5 penalty to find them (i.e. Awareness vs. Stealth) via scent because while their own odor is eliminated, this jutsu leaves a faint scent of smoke. In fact, a TN 35 Research roll can identify the use of this technique at, say, a crime scene. If used to treat an injury (external injuries which have left open wounds only), this accelerates the recipient's healing time by 25%, but does not stack with the reduction from medical treatment (doctors can do much better than this improvised first aid).

#### --( Ikari o Moe no Jutsu - Blazing Fury Technique )--
A very, very popular technique among hand-to-hand combatants, whose opinions of it range from "pretty cool" to "totally awesome", this wreathes their hands, and sometimes feet, elbow, and knees, in a faint reddish glow of chakra. When they strike, that chakra ignites on impact, resulting in a burst of flame being delivered to their unfortunate foe. It's quite flashy.

 - Chakra: 18
 - Upkeep: 3
 - Speed: 8
 - Seal Speed: 14
 - Tags: Nintaijutsu, Energy, Preparation

Effects: This technique alters the dice of any unarmed attacks you make. Its damage dice become .extra(3) for d4s, .extra(5) for d6s, .extra(6) for d8s, .extra(7) for d10s, .extra(9) for d12s, and .extra(15) for d20s. An attack which would normally deal 8d12 damage would be changed to deal 8d12.extra(9) damage under the effects of Blazing Fury. Additionally, if an attack augmented by Blazing Fury inflicts wounds of any sort, it also causes an Energy wound of one category lower, to a minimum of minor (a punch that inflicted a Minor Blunt wound would also inflict a Minor Energy wound).

## B-Rank
#### --( Karyuu Endan - Fire Dragon Flame Bullet )--
The shinobi gathers chakra in their mouth, before converting it to fire and shooting it out. The flame shoots out in three sections, each one taking on the appearance of a serpentine dragon which explodes on impact with its own target.

 - Chakra: 34
 - Damage: 22d20.extra(11)
 - Range: 40
 - Special: Burns 5, Ignite 7
 - Speed: 18
 - Seal Speed: 22
 - Tags: Energy, Projectile

Effects: This technique may target up to three separate people. You may not direct these 'extra' attacks at the same person for added damage. Anyone hit by this technique makes a status roll, and on a failure, the status effects are doubled.

#### --( Gouryuuka no Jutsu - Great Dragon Fire Technique )--
The user of this technique compresses a large amount of chakra in their body, and exhales it as a single, massive burst of fire in the shape of a dragon's head. Due to this technique's nature, enough of the chakra used in it is retained briefly in the user's body to swiftly prepare a second blast.

 - Chakra: 32
 - Damage: 15d20.extra(11)
 - Range: 35
 - Speed: 16
 - Seal Speed: 20
 - Tags: Energy, Projectile

Effects: If this was the last jutsu you performed, its Chakra cost is reduced by 4 and its Seal Speed by 2, and it gains +2 Accuracy. These bonuses stack, bringing it as low as Chakra 16 and Seal Speed 12, and giving up to +8 Accuracy.

#### --( Joushou Ootori - Rising Phoenix Blast )--
The user gathers chakra around them--the 'rising phoenix' actually refers to the visible heat ripples and wisps of flame rising around the ninja performing it-- and unleashes a stream of dark, searingly hot fire at their opponents. The flames of this technique are hot enough to disintegrate most incoming attacks.

 - Chakra: 26
 - Damage: 10d20.open(16)
 - Accuracy: +3
 - Range: 20
 - Special: Interrupt
 - Speed: 12
 - Seal Speed: 14
 - Tags: Energy, Projectile

Effects: When used as an attack, it receives double your ninjutsu damage bonus.  When used as an Interrupt, Rising Phoenix Blast's damage becomes 10d20.open(11). It functions differently if when used against a melee attack, or ranged ninjutsu attack. It may Interrupt attacks so long as its Speed is equal to or less than theirs (rather than needing to be equal to or less than half the original attack's Speed).

Against a melee action: The user may choose to call off their attack, or press on regardless of the danger. If they do not cancel their attack, they take Rising Phoenix Blast's full damage, without any defense. However, you are also hit by their attack automatically, and cannot defend against it. If they choose to defend themselves, their attack is cancelled; they do not pay any Chakra or Stamina costs, and it's considered half its actual speed for determining when their next action comes; any AP or other effects spent on it, however, are not regained. They then defend against Rising Phoenix Blast, with a +3 bonus to any d20 rolls made as part of their defense.

Against a ranged ninjutsu attack: This can only be used against targeted, damage-dealing ninjutsu aimed at you, or any damage-dealing Fuuton ninjutsu which would hit you. Compare the damage of the two techniques; if the damage of theirs is higher, subtract Rising Phoenix Blast's damage from that technique's damage; that is how much you take. If your technique's damage is higher, it destroys the opponent's technique, protecting you from it, and your enemy must then defend against your Rising Phoenix Blast (which does its full damage normally). Rising Phoenix Blast's damage is raised by 50% if it interrupts (or is interrupted by) a Wind Release technique, and lowered by 50% when interrupting Water Release techniques. If an attacker is beyond the range of this technique, it can still be used to defend against it, but the return attack will automatically miss (due to its lack of range).

#### --( Akuchori Nabe - Devil's Cooking Pot )--
This technique is known for two things. The first is the distinctive, raspy sound made when the user exhales the dark gray cloud of smoke produced by this technique, rather like a death rattle. The second is being wantonly destructive. Due to the composition of the cloud's chakra, it ignites at the outside first, and implodes upon itself, creating a pyroclastic pressure-cooker effect.

 - Chakra: 24
 - Area: 30
 - Range: 20
 - Speed: 12
 - Seal Speed: 28
 - Tags: Area of Effect, Environmental

Effects: Any non-environmental Katon jutsu of C-rank or higher will be sufficient to ignite the cloud. This increases that technique's damage by 25% and changes it dice from .extra() to .open(), and everyone within the cloud's area must defend against it. If the technique also has an area of effect, add half of the lower AoE (Akuchori Nabe's or that of the technique which detonated it) to the full higher one; this is the area for the new, combined technique.

If this technique is placed in an area where it immediately detonates on the same IC in which it is used, it can be dodged normally as an Area of Effect attack of its normal size and speed.

#### --( Jikoku Kasou no Jutsu - Instant Cremation Technique )--
Arguably the most stylish jutsu in existence, after performing the requisite handseals the user keeps their hands charged with chakra (though they do not glow, or burn). From that point on, all they have to do is point at a target and focus for a few seconds, and a location will erupt in flames. While this does make it somewhat difficult to evade, there are several telltale signs (aside from the, you know, pointing). The area heats up rapidly, and there's a low, rising hum near the point where the flash of fire is imminent, as the chakra being directed there builds and prepares to ignite.

 - Chakra: 20
 - Damage: 5d20.open(20 - X)
 - Accuracy: +4
 - Range: 25
 - Special: Ignite X/2
 - Speed: 12
 - Seal Speed: 16
 - Tags: Energy

Effects: After using Instant Cremation, you can choose to gain a Special Upkeep X, which increases by 2 each time you use Instant Cremation. This Special Upkeep is unaffected by Uniques and Wounds which modify Upkeeps, but otherwise functions the same. So long as X is 2 or greater, Instant Cremation's does not require handseals. Thus, if you had used Instant Cremation three times, you would have an Upkeep 6, and your next use of it would deal 5d20.open(14) damage. Regardless of how high X goes, Instant Cremation may not deal more than 5d20.open(4) damage. If you end the Upkeep, and then use Instant Cremation again, the Upkeep will begin at 2, starting all over again.

#### --( Enjoukon no Jutsu - Blazing Soul Technique )--
All ninja learn how to convert their chakra into one of the five basic elemental natures; doing so is how they perform elemental ninjutsu. This dangerous, advanced technique takes that to its (il)logical conclusion. The user converts a majority of their chakra to fire-elemental. This offers the obvious advantage of drastically increasing the efficiency of any jutsu using that chakra--however, doing so is puts a significant strain upon one's chakra circulatory system, impeding its normal functioning. When this technique is maintained, a person's skin is notably hot to the touch.

 - Chakra: 20
 - Upkeep: 4
 - Speed: 12
 - Seal Speed: 16
 - Requires: 25 Chakra Control
 - Tags: Preparation

Effects: So long as Enjoukon is maintained, the Chakra costs of all your Katon jutsu are reduced by 5, and their damage is increased by 15%. When your Chakra Exhaustion penalty increases from using a Katon technique, it increases by 1 point less than normal (to a minimum of 0). However, the chakra costs for all your non-Katon elemental ninjutsu are increased by 5. Even after this technique ends, its effects persist for the next 20 IC as your chakra gradually returns to normal.

## A-Rank
#### --( Karyuudan - Fire Dragon Bullet )--
Generally considered to be the pinnacle of how destructive a technique can be without rendering it useless in a majority of situations, the user forms a mass of fire in the vague shape of a dragon's head in front of them, and then fires a volley of blazing projectiles at their unfortunate target of choice.

 - Chakra: 48
 - Damage: 60d20.extra(16)
 - Accuracy: +3
 - Range: 60
 - Speed: 26
 - Seal Speed: 26
 - Tags: Energy, Projectile

Effects: This technique inflicts Burns of (damage dealt)/100; on a failed status roll, it's instead (damage dealt)/50. You may target up to three people with this technique, using the same Accuracy for each. You can not target the same person repeatedly to enhance the technique's effect.

#### --( Insei Reisai no Jutsu - Meteor Carnival Technique )--
The go-to jutsu for dispatching swaths of enemies as quickly as possible, for those who are able to perform it and don't mind ruining the scenery. Compared to other wide-area techniques, it has the advantage of, for the most part, being able to avoid hitting one's allies indiscriminately.
The user launches an incandescent globe of fire into the sky, where it remains stationary and periodically launches smaller, roughly pumpkin-sized exploding fireballs across the battlefield; on impact, they explode!

 - Chakra: 32
 - Upkeep: 10
 - Damage: 24d20.extra(16)
 - Range: 150
 - Speed: 16
 - Seal Speed: 28
 - Tags: Area of Effect, Energy, Projectile

Effects: A volley of fireballs falls upon the battlefield when you first use this technique, and every 20 IC afterwards so long as you maintain its Upkeep. This technique uses your base Accuracy for an A-rank Katon, unmodified by status, wounds, temporary bonuses, and so on, though penalties from Fatigue do apply. The ninjutsu damage bonus is equal to yours at the time you used the technique. Because the attacks are made by the technique, and not you, you cannot modify them further (such as with Willpower or AP). 

Each volley may target up to (NDB) individuals within its Range. Each targeted individual has a fireball fall on them, and detonate with an Area of (NDB). Each fireball (including the initial one) is considered a Speed 10 attack for the purposes of defending and damage (rather than using the listed Speed above). A single individual may only take damage once per volley; if you targeted four fireballs at each of four people who were standing next to each other, they would only need to make one defense and would, at most, take damage from a single fireball.

#### --( Ryuujin Bakuha - Dragon King Blast )--
The pinnacle of wide-area indiscriminate destruction. The user exhales a cloud of not-quite-invisible vapor with a metallic taste, which rapidly expands. Once they've finished, they channel just a small bit of chakra into it, turning the gas from inert to violently reactive and engulfing the area in a fireball which has no peer. The user is protected from this explosion; their friends, however, are not.

 - Chakra: 45
 - Damage: 40d20.open(11)
 - Range: 20
 - Area: Radius of (Damage Bonus)*10 yards.
 - Speed: 30, Delay 20
 - Seal Speed: 22
 - Special: Burns 10, Ignite 20, Stun 10
 - Tags: Area of Effect, Blunt, Energy, Environmental

Effects: Every initiative count in the delay, this technique gains 5% of its damage, radius, and effects. The use of any non-environmental Katon jutsu of C-rank or above (or the presence of any person suffering from an Ignite status of 10 or greater) in this area will detonate it prematurely. If an effect is used which would disperse the gas cloud during the Delay period, its damage, range, and effects all reset to 0%; and can be built back up by continuing it. You may choose to detonate this when you finish it (in which case you will probably be in the area of effect; however, you take only half damage from your own Ryuujin Bakuha), or not. If not, it'll remain until detonated by the presence of someone with an Ignite 10, or a Katon jutsu of C-rank or above. Ryuujin Bakuha inflicts an Energy wound, and two Blunt wounds of the same severity. If it's used in a confined space (such as indoors, or in a cave) it does an additional 10d20.open(16) damage, and its effects are raised to Burns 20, Ignite 25, and Stun 20. Anyone who succeeds in a status roll when hit by this technique suffers only half the normal status effects.

If this technique is placed in an area where it immediately detonates on the same IC in which it is used, it can be dodged normally as an Area of Effect attack of its normal size and speed, even if it is detonated immediately by a person with an Ignite status setting it off.

#### --( Sunde Bakudan - Living Bomb )--
A technique invented in the middle of the Third Shinobi World War--and, as the horrors from that era go, it's only slightly atrocious. The user molds a mass of volatile fire-elemental chakra and, rather than forming it into a jutsu, injects it directly into a foe. The chakra will last a few minutes at most, before surging through their chakra coils violently and turning them into the catalyst for a powerful explosion. It saw extensive use for taking out medics who'd rush to the battlefield to retrieve injured comrades, only to be killed or wounded in the ensuing explosion.

 - Chakra: 25, raised to 40 if it hits
 - Damage: 30d20.open(11)
 - Range: Touch
 - Speed: 16
 - Seal Speed: 20
 - Tags: Energy, Melee

Effects: This technique initially does no damage (and thus, can not have Sudden Attack used with it). Whoever you hit with this technique becomes a living bomb! When you place this technique, you also set a timer, between 1 and (Chakra Control ranks * 5) IC, after which they will detonate. You may also perform a Speed 5, Seal Speed 20 action to detonate someone immediately. When a person is detonated, they make a Chakra 30 roll; whether they pass or fail has no effect on the technique, though as normal they might advance in Fatigue. The explosion itself has an Area of your NDB*2. The bomb themselves may not defend against it, though anyone else can, treating it as an attack of the Speed it was used at, though it benefits from only half your NDB. The technique's damage is considered 25% higher for the purposes of wounding the bomb.

#### --( Maru o Moyashi no Jutsu - Burning Circle Technique )--
Popular among bounty-hunting ninja, this technique creates a circular wall of flame surrounding an area. While it's by no means impregnable, attempting to charge through a virtually solid sheet of chakra-fueled fire tends to have the expected result. It's useful both for ensuring an opponent won't run away (or making them pay for trying to do so), and for keeping an adversary isolated from the battle.

 - Chakra: 34
 - Upkeep: 8
 - Damage: 40d20.extra(6)
 - Range: 50
 - Area: (NDB), Up to (ninjutsu damage bonus) * 4
 - Speed: 24
 - Seal Speed: 26
 - Status: (NDB) Burns, (NDB) Ignite
 - Tags: Energy, Environmental

Effects: This creates a circular wall of flame centered on a target within its range (which can be you), with the listed area as its radius. The wall itself is 1 yard thick (wide), and (NDB * 4) yards tall. Anyone who crosses the wall takes the listed damage and status effects on a failed status roll. As it does not constitute an attack at that point, defensive Interrupts can't be used to mitigate it, though your NDB for its damage is halved.  

If you attempt to place this wall directly on someone when first using it, anyone it is placed under is allowed to defend against it normally, suffering no penalties due to its Area, and can choose to end up on either side of it (on the inside or outside of the ring).
