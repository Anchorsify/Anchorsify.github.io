## E-Rank
#### --( Ganseki Tsuppari - Rock Thrust )--
Often stomping beforehand, you then motion forward and either shoot a narrow column or spike at your opponent, or a rock of decent size. Whichever way, this is the weakest of any Doton.

 - Chakra: 9
 - Damage: 8d10
 - Range: 6
 - Speed: 12
 - Seal Speed: 6
 - Tags: Blunt, Projectile

#### --( Mimizu no Jutsu - Earthworm Technique )--
Sending a tiny rumble through the earth ahead of you, you cause the area around your opponents to explosively sprout spikes from the ground into their ankles and shins! It's rather painful and good for catching a small group of opponents.

 - Chakra: 8
 - Damage: 6d4
 - Range: 10
 - Area: 5
 - Speed: 10
 - Seal Speed: 6
 - Tags: Piercing, Area of Effect, Environmental, Ground

Effects: Dodging this technique allows people to avoid its initial damage, but they are still inside the field of rock spikes. Anyone inside the affected area who moves by any means other than the Move action (Shunshin, Racing Thunder, Water Shark Blast, etc) takes Xd4+NDB*X, with X being the number of yards travelled within the area. This technique can not inflict Wounds.

#### --( Monosugai no Jutsu - Earth Shaping Technique )--
You inject your own chakra through your hands into a natural surface to allow it's texture to become more like mud or clay as your fingers sink into it. This can be used to all sorts of ends. Making a statue, digging a hole, climbing a wall, whatever you want! ...As long as it has to do with rocks and stuff.

 - Chakra: 10
 - Speed: 8
 - Seal Speed: 4

Effects: You can shape the surface of a rock, or mold it in your hands like clay. If you use this before climbing an earthen surface (be it a cliff face or a castle wall) you gain a +5 bonus to Athletics checks associated with climbing it, by making hand- and footholds (for yourself only). This doesn't work if you're, saying, climbing up the side of a cliff face using a rope. I really shouldn't have needed to say that, but, yanno.

#### --( Yurokensei - Tremorsense )--
Often placing a hand to the ground after the seals to feel the vibrations, this technique helps you find nearby creatures and enemies. Most importantly, enemies! Their steps, no matter how quiet, can be sensed by you from a great distance!

 - Chakra: 10
 - Speed: 10
 - Range: 10 + Chakra Control Ranks
 - Seal Speed: 6

Effects: Make a Chakra Control roll against anyone touching the ground or any rock surfance (including worked stone, such as brick walls) to locate anyone and everyone within range (i.e., it opposed their Stealth TN). Anyone not hidden is located automatically; if you find someone you locate them just as if you'd used the Search action, though you do not retain 'sight' of them. This cannot be used to identify someone who is hidden amongst clones, and in fact means you cannot use the Observe action to differentiate someone from their clones if this technique is your only way of perceiving your opponent (from being temporarily blinded, etc).

You can use Yurokensei without breaking your stealth.

#### --( Shindou - Tremor )--
Extra earth-elemental chakra is infused another Doton technique. When the technique hits the ground, or somebody touching the ground, it causes the earth itself to shake violently in that exact spot. The property damage potential's pretty impressive, but nothing compared to serious offensive jutsu.

 - Chakra: +5, +1 per rank above E
 - Speed: +2
 - Seal Speed: +3
 - Tags: Area of Effect, Environmental, Ground

Effects: This technique is used in combination with a non-projectile damage-dealing Doton jutsu, increasing its Seal Speed and Chakra cost accordingly. This technique has a area of 3 yards, +3 yards per rank above E. Notably, anyone who is actually airborne ("jumping as they dodge" doesn't count) is unaffected. Anyone hit within this area makes a status roll to avoid taking a Stun 3, +1 per rank the jutsu Shindou was used with is above E; if the technique Shindou was used with already inflicts a Stun, that Stun is increased by the jutsu's rank (instead of Shindou's normal effect) with E being 1, D being 2, etc, and only requires a status roll if the jutsu it's used with asks for one. Anyone not targeted by the original attack must dodge Shindou, in which case the original technique's Accuracy bonuses or penalties are ignored, and they do make a status roll.

This can also be used on its own as Chakra 11, Speed 8, and Seal Speed 4. In this case it's Area 10, Stun 5, centered on (but not affecting) yourself, and in such case can be dodged or otherwise defended against as normal, in addition to the normal status roll for its Stun.

## D-Rank
#### --( Doki Kantsuu no Jutsu - Earthen Skewer Technique )--
Rock Thrust, except actually meant to do serious harm to people outside of training matches. You summon a spike of earth actually capable of skewering an enemy! This can also be more of a solid hit, not as pointy, as to whatever degree they want, and can even look like a fist or some similar, stylized attack, but it's still just big rocks coming at you.

 - Chakra: 16
 - Damage: 16d12*1
 - Range: 12
 - Speed: 14
 - Seal Speed: 12
 - Status: Stun 4
 - Tags: Piercing, Ground

Effects: This technique has its damage increased by 10% for Wounding.

#### --( Tama no Nendo - Clay Bullet )--
Pushing your chakra into the ground beneath you, you pull up a ball of earth and mud, globby and chakra filled that you then launch or literally throw sometimes at the opponent. Once on them, the mud is held semi-cohesive by the chakra lacing it, which can restrict the victim's movement.

 - Chakra: 14
 - Damage: 8d10
 - Range: 8
 - Speed: 12
 - Seal Speed: 10
 - Status: Immobility 5
 - Tags: Blunt, Projectile

#### --( Iwa Funsai Buin - Rock Smashing Staff )--
You hold out your hands or similarly grab some nearby rock and create a large, blunt object from it! This is often a hammer or staff, but also could be stylized however you see fit. As we all know, getting hit with rocks hurts, so this is rather painful.

 - Chakra: 15
 - Upkeep: 2
 - Speed: 10
 - Seal Speed: 12
 - Tags: Nintaijutsu, Preparation

Effects: You create a bo staff or tetsubo out of rocks or dense, chakra-congealed earth. When using it, you add one-fourth of your Ninjutsu Damage Bonus to your Physical Damage Bonus, and the weapon has Stun 4 (or increases its existing Stun by 3). This weapon persists until you let go of it.

#### --( Shinjuu Zanshu no Jutsu - Double Suicide Decapitation Technique )--
After thoroughly concealing yourself, this technique allows you to move through the ground for a short amount of time, long enough though to position yourself under the enemy and pull them down under the ground.

 - Chakra: 18
 - Range: 8
 - Speed: 10
 - Seal Speed: 8
 - Tags: Melee, Ground

Effects: This technique can only be used if you are hidden from your target or underground, and uses your melee Taijutsu accuracy (rather than Ninjutsu). If used when hidden (but not underground), you briefly submerge underground and then move to melee range with your target to grab and pull them into the earth as you pop up from underneath them.

If you hit, you inflict them with a -1 Immobilization Penalty per point your Accuracy beats their defense, to a maximum of -6. They can dig themselves out from underground as a Speed 10 action which removes the penalty entirely. Until they get rid of the Immobilization penalty from this technique they can not move (as they are stuck to the spot), but can otherwise attack and defend themselves.

#### --( Doro Bunshin no Jutsu - Mud Clone Technique )--
An advanced variation of Bunshin no Jutsu, this jutsu creates solid clones made from the earth beneath a shinobi's feet, which change their appearance to look like the user. They have many advantages over normal clones, but are significantly more difficult to create.

 - Chakra: 12, +4 per clone
 - Speed: 6, +1 per clone
 - Seal Speed: 4, +2 per clone
 - Requires: Bunshin no Jutsu
 - Tags: Clone

Effects: These follow all the rules for regular bunshin, with the following exceptions: If a mud clone is hit by an unarmed attack, their attacker suffers a -4 immobilization penalty. If they are struck by a melee weapon, their attacker must make a grapple roll (as the defender), with your clone using NDB in place of PDB; if they fail, the weapon is stuck in the clone (which is exposed as a clone), and it must be wrested free from the clone's mud body as a Speed 5 action which allows another grapple roll with a +2 bonus for each prior attempt. 

Against ranged attacks, these clones can take 50 points of damage before being destroyed (and revealed as clones).

#### --( Doryu Ken - Earth Style Fist )--
By surrounding your arm or leg in a coat of solidified earth, you can attack an opponent while being protected from direct contact with them.

 - Chakra: 12
 - Upkeep: 2 + X
 - Speed: 6
 - Seal Speed: 12
 - Tags: Nintaijutsu, Preparation

Effects: So long as this technique is maintained, your unarmed attacks are enhanced: You suffer no 'on-contact' effects (such as damage from punching a foe covered in spikes, or the immobilization of punching a Mud Clone), and gain +X to your Physical Damage Bonus. Additionally, unarmed parries against you take a -X penalty. X has a maximum of one-fourth your Ninjutsu Damage Bonus, rounded up.

## C-Rank
#### --( Retsudotensho - Split Earth Turn Around Palm )--
This technique causes the ground surrounding the enemy to spiral inwards on itself, burying them alive or crushing them. This technique is capable of causing quite a bit of damage to the area. This technique is much more damaging if used in rocky mountainous areas, or inside a cave.

 - Chakra: 26
 - Damage: 28d12
 - Range: 25
 - Area: 15
 - Speed: 20
 - Seal Speed: 18
 - Tags: Blunt, Area of Effect, Ground

Effects: Anyone hit by this technique suffers a Stun and Immobilization Penalty equal to the amount their defensive roll failed by, to a maximum of Stun 8 and -8 Immobilization. The Immobility penalty lasts until they leave the affected area (and does not fade naturally over time), which has all other Ground effects removed.

If someone uses a defense which does not require a roll, and takes damage from this technique, they instead make a status roll (and take both the Stun and Immobility penalty if they fail, as described above). If used in a cave, the Stun and Immobilization penalty is always 8.

#### --( Doryuu Taiga - Earth Flow River )--
You cause a long stretch of nearby ground to become mud and slide your opponents down a torrenting river of rocks and dirt, spewing them out at the end. This often leaves people hurt, and disoriented!

 - Chakra: 22
 - Damage: 10d20
 - Area: Line 6 wide, 12 long
 - Speed: 16
 - Seal Speed: 16
 - Tags: Blunt, Area of Effect, Ground

Effects: This moves anyone hit by it to the end of the line in the direction the river 'flows': the line originates from you, but can flow out to knock opponents back, or toward, to push them closer. Everyone receives a Stun equal to how many yards they move -6; blocking results in no Stun. If this is blocked by an effect which halts its progress (such as Earth Shore Return), nobody behind that effect is affected (or pushed).

#### --( Doroku Gaeshi - Earth Shore Return )--
Slamming both hands into the ground, the user can cause a large rectangle wall of earth to pop up in front up them, covering whatever attack someone may be directing at them.

 - Chakra: 18
 - Range: 16
 - Special: Interrupt
 - Speed: 8
 - Seal Speed: 8
 - Tags: Ground, Wall

Effects: This creates a wall 4 yards wide and 3 yards high that takes the hit from an attack. This wall absorbs 200 + 10* (Ninjutsu damage bonus) damage. If destroyed, any remaining damage carries on to you (in which case you cannot defend against it further) or whoever else you used this to protect (in which case, they can). As implied up there, this can be used to protect anyone in range. 

However, Earth Shore Return can't be used against melee attacks, attacks with the 'Ground' tag, or ranged attacks originating 5 yards or less away from who its meant to protect. After having all its HP depleted, or at the end of the IC it was used on, the wall crumbles into dirt and gravel. The wall takes +50% damage from Raiton, and half damage from Suiton.

#### --( Doro Nami no Jutsu - Mud Wave Technique )--
Your chakra being applied to your legs, you turn the ground below your feet into mud which you then stand upon, riding the wave at increased speeds as you flow across the battlefield. This is a good mode of transportation, and a good way to enhance an earth attack!

 - Chakra: 16
 - Upkeep: 3
 - Speed: 6
 - Seal Speed: 14
 - Tags: Preparation

Effects: You increase your AGI stat for the purposes of movement by CHA/2. You may choose to end this technique at any time, or as part of another Doton jutsu. If you end it as part of a damage dealing Doton jutsu, that technique gains a Stun equal to 2+(your ninjutsu damage bonus)/3, or increases its existing Stun by that much, from absorbing the mud used in this technique. This is incompatible with effects which increase your normal movement speed--such as the Runner ability, and Racing Thunder Technique. While Mud Wave is active, you do not receive their benefits.

#### --( Moguragakure no Jutsu - Hiding Like a Mole Technique )--
Channeling your chakra into the ground below you, you turn the dirt or earth or rock into fine sand. It effects your entire body so you simply slide down quickly, but only making a tunnel big enough for one person. After digging your way down, you can sense everything going on above still, and can even cover the hole to make it seem like you never even burrowed away.

 - Chakra: 20
 - Special: Interrupt
 - Speed: 12
 - Seal Speed: 12

Effects: You dive down a yard underground, but are afflicted with a with Stun 12. If used as an Interrupt, this requires a dodge roll with a +5 bonus; success, even partial, will allow you to trigger the second half of this jutsu.

Next, roll Espionage +5 vs. Awareness. If you are successful, the opponents can't tell how you left, or that there's a hole in the ground: They think you simply vanished, or died (if used as an interrupt against a sufficiently impressive attack). You are hidden at Stealth 2 against anyone whose Awareness you beat, but cannot move, aside from resurfacing (a simple, Speed 0 action once you can move again). For every time you use this jutsu in the same combat after the first, you take a cumulative -5 to your Espionage roll. While underground, you have an additional +5 Stealth and attempts to Track you take a -5 penalty, but anyone can attack you while you are under the ground, and any defensive roll you take while submerged takes a -6 penalty. An attack which deals at least 100 damage will break through the surface of the earth above you, ending your submerged state forcefully, but the actual damage dealt to you will be reduced by half (after seeing if it does enough to break the earth above you).

#### --( Dochuu Eigyo no Jutsu - Moving Underground as if Swimming Technique )--
This technique reduces the consistency of earth into less than that of fine sand by channeling chakra into it, allowing the user to dig through it with ease. This affects the entire body, and the earth returns to its normal consistency after they've passed.

 - Chakra: 18
 - Upkeep: 4
 - Speed: 12
 - Seal Speed: 12
 - Tags: Preparation

Effects: This may only be used while underground, such as from the effects of Moguragakure no Jutsu, to burrow through solid rock, and can be used while Stealthed without revealing you. It works only on earth and unworked stone (you could burst out from under stone tiles, but not tunnel through a wall). While you maintain this technique's upkeep, you can move underground up to a yard deep (any deeper any you would begin to be crushed by the pressure of the earth around you), using CHA/2 in place of AGI for determining your movement speed. 

Anyone can attack you while you are under the ground, and any defensive roll you take while submerged takes a -6 penalty. An attack which deals at least 100 damage will break through the surface of the earth above you, ending this jutsu forcibly, but the actual damage dealt to you will be reduced by half (after seeing if it does enough to break the earth above you).

## B-Rank
#### --( Doryou Dango - Earth Mausoleum Dumpling )--
Channelling chakra into your arms and the ground below you, you place your hands on the earth and lift up an incredibly large (no, really, just look at the Area on this thing!) ball of earth and rock, which is then thrown at your enemies.

 - Chakra: 38
 - Damage: 44d20*1
 - Range: 50
 - Area: 25
 - Speed: 24, Delay 10
 - Seal Speed: 26
 - Status: Stun 12
 - Tags: Blunt, Area of Effect, Projectile

#### --( Doryuukatsu - Earth Flow Divide )--
Flowing your energy into special underground 'Dragon Veins' (that means chakra leylines, not a literal dragon's body--I'm talking to you, Takuto) you can literally make a tear in the earth, and create a large chasms. This is most often used as a way of breaking through a large wall, destroying an enemy camp or other barricades and such.

 - Chakra: 34
 - Damage: 25d20*1
 - Range: Special
 - Speed: 24
 - Seal Speed: 18
 - Tags: Blunt, Area of Effect, Ground

Effects: Any damage from this technique is tripled against an inanimate, stationary object. Don't even ask if this tripling can be done against a player or NPC. This can selectively target anything on a line with a length of your Chakra Control skill ranks in yards, and a width of 5 yards.

#### --( Dorou Domu Kekkai - Earth Prison Dome of Magnificient Nothingness )--
This creates a dome chamber around a small group of enemies, which you enlace in your own chakra to make it extra hard to escape.

 - Chakra: 32
 - Upkeep: 8
 - Area: 20
 - Speed: 18
 - Seal Speed: 16
 - Tags: Area of Effect, Ground

Effects: This creates a dome of earth directly in front of you, with you at the edge of its area. Anyone who fails to avoid it is trapped inside the dome; those that succeed in their defense are allowed to move to any side of it, or to simply be on top of it.

The dome has 400 + (Ninjutsu damage bonus)*10 HP; anyone who can see or sense Chakra can target the dome's weak spot to deal +50% damage to it. Every 10 IC which pass, the following effects occur:
 - Everyone inside the dome has their Chakra Exhaustion penalty increased by 1.
 - You have your Chakra penalty reduced by 1 per person inside the dome.
 - The dome regains (Ninjutsu damage bonus)*10 HP, up to its maximum.

You must keep one hand on the dome at all times, and accordingly can not move; if you break contact the above effects end (and cannot be reestablished), but the dome retains any HP it had at that point.

Attempts to go underground will be prevented and automatically fail while the Dome retains hit points, such as through Moguragakure no Jutsu.  Earth Shaping, similarly, will not work to damage the dome, as it is constantly reinforced with Chakra.  Similarly, other area of effect upkeeps (such as Grudge Rain) will not work on anyone within Dorou Domu, as the dome protects them from its effects while it's retained (though the person outside of the dome is certainly effected). Effects which are not upkeeps (such as Dokugiri), if already present when this technique is used, continue to persist within the dome and affect everyone within the dome normally.

If the Dome is broken by an area of effect attack, any overflow damage remaining from the attack which broke the dome carries through to affect everyone outside of the dome according to its normal area, though they can then defend against it as normal.

#### --( Doryuu Jouheki - Earth Flow Rampart )--
Feeding your chakra into the ground you cause the earth to rise under your feet into a large rampart. The shape of the rampart can be anything from level ground to a steep, needle like mountain, and it is mostly used for walling something off, slowing down pursuers, or reaching that jar off the top shelf that is always so hard to reach.

 - Chakra: X
 - Speed: 20
 - Seal Speed: 20

Effects: You create what is basically a huge wall! It can be up to the following dimensions: Length = X, Width = X/4, Height = X/2. If you use this and X is 20 or more, the area you are in counts as rocky terrain for the purposes of jutsu requirements.  X has a maximum of (5+ Chakra Control ranks).

#### --( Iwagakure no Jutsu - Hidden Among Rocks Technique )--
This technique allows you to blend into rocks and remain hidden. Even the texture of your body takes on that of the stones, and it's quite possible (indeed, more than a few experienced jounin have embarrassing stories about it) to have an enemy physically sit on you without realizing you're there.

 - Chakra: 32
 - Upkeep: 12
 - Speed: 22
 - Seal Speed: 28
 - Tags: Preparation

Effects: You can use this technique to blend into rocky terrain—in fact, it requires rocky terrain to work (the inside of a cave, a mountain path, the debris from a destroyed stone wall, or a large boulder all work, but notably an *intact* stone wall would not).  When used, you hide with a +10 bonus to your Stealth roll and begin at level 3 Stealth against anyone who does not have reason to suspect you are there (i.e., they are not seeing you use the technique, and it is not being done in combat, either of which causes this to automatically fail). While maintaining the technique, you cannot move (blinking and breathing are okay).

#### --( Domu - Earth Spear )--
You direct chakra to flow through the skin over all portions of your body, increasing your body's defensive power to its utmost limit. This causes your skin to darken in response to the earth-elemented chakra, taking on a dull gray-brown, almost black color. This hardening also empowers your physical attacks, making this a useful, if draining, all-purpose technique.

 - Chakra: 27
 - Upkeep: 10
 - Speed: 16
 - Seal Speed: 17
 - Tags: Preparation

Effects: You gain (CHA) Damage Reduction, and increase your physical damage bonus by half your ninjutsu damage bonus. Raiton bypasses all this technique's effects, and Suiton has its damage lowered by twice as much (a DR of CHA*2, rather than just CHA).

#### --( Doryuuheki - Earth Style Wall )--
The most powerful direct Doton-based defense, the user either manipulates the surrounding terrain or generates (using chakra!) and spits out an prodigious amount of flowing earth which forms a wall and solidifies. Either way, this creates a barrier coated with chakra that will stop most attacks totally.

 - Chakra: 26
 - Special: Interrupt
 - Speed: 20
 - Seal Speed: 24
 - Tags: Ground, Wall

Effects: You create a wall of earth that blocks up to (50 + (NDB * 2))*(Speed) damage. It takes 50% extra damage from Raiton, but only half damage from Suiton. You may use Action Points to reduce Doryuuheki's (base) Seal Speed, on a 1:1 basis, to as low as 12. Note that if you are able to use Doryuuheki as an interrupt, you may do so without the need for a roll. 

Earth Style Wall can't be used against melee attacks, attacks with the 'Ground' tag, or ranged attacks originating 5 yards or less away from anyone it's meant to protect.  Against area of effect attacks, this may protect multiple people, as long as they are more than five yards away from the center of the area of effect and can all be placed behind the same 15 yard long line.

#### --( Iwa Bunshin - Rock Clone )--
You either gather animate rocks from you, or actually generate them with chakra and regurgitate a stream of stones (somehow, you're protected from a cut esophagus or chipped teeth during this process). Either way, the rocks then take on a human shape and appearance.

 - Chakra: 10, +6 per clone
 - Speed: 10, +2 per clone
 - Seal Speed: 10, +3 per clone
 - Requires: Bunshin no Jutsu
 - Tags: Clone

Effects: You may create up to 3 clones that can look like yourself or anyone else present. If they look like someone else, that person may then hide amongst your clones to receive the normal benefits of having clones; these can even be added to their own clones. 

Rock clones can take 100 + (your ninjutsu damage bonus) * 5 points of damage before being destroyed, or exposed as clones, and take only half damage from AoE attacks. 

These function like regular bunshin, except that Rock clones use your attributes, even if they're imitating someone else. They may dodge, as well as the following:
 - [ 4 AP ] Attack: The clone may perform a basic unarmed attack. This does benefit from Power Attack or Unarmed Focus, if you have those abilities, but the clone does not need to make a Stamina roll.
 - [ X AP ] Move: Every 3 Speed of the Move action costs 1 AP.

## A-Rank
#### --( Doryuudan - Earth Dragon Blast )--
A dragon-like head of rock, mud, and dirt rises up from the ground, its maw wide open. From said maw, it launches dozens of high-velocity projectiles of dense, chakra-infused earth! While not as visually impressive as some techniques, Doryuudan is incredibly demanding upon its user--and incredibly devastating to its victims.

 - Chakra: 50
 - Damage: 80d20*1
 - Range: 60
 - Accuracy: +2
 - Speed: 40
 - Seal Speed: 36
 - Status: Stun 20
 - Tags: Blunt, Projectile

Effects: Blocking reduces this technique's damage by only 25%.

#### --( Iwa Renda no Jutsu - Rock Barrage Technique )--
After performing the necessary seals, the user channels chakra into the rocks and stone around them. Their chakra causes large rocks to shatter into smaller ones, which are then launched as high-velocity projectiles towards potentially dozens of targets.

 - Chakra: 48
 - Damage: 20d20*1
 - Accuracy: +2
 - Range: 25
 - Speed: 30
 - Seal Speed: 26
 - Tags: Blunt, Projectile

Effects: You may hit up to (NDB) targets. You may target the same person multiple times, up to one quarter of your maximum. Every additional 'target' spent on them gives a +1 bonus to Accuracy (against that target only) and increases the damage by 5d20.

#### --( Yomi Numa - Swamp of the Underworld )--
This changes the surface of the ground across a broad area into a viscous, muddy morass. While the amount of chakra required to perform this technique can be prohibitive in most combat situations, this technique, when properly used, can give incredible tactical control over an area.

 - Chakra: 34
 - Range: 150
 - Area: 100
 - Speed: 16
 - Seal Speed: 28
 - Tags: Area of Effect, Environmental, Ground

Effects: The swamp imposes a -12 immobilization penalty on anyone caught in it, which, after all reductions and modifications, may not exceed -9. This immobilization penalty fades at the normal rate of 1 per 10 IC.

You may adjust the affected area within the limits of this jutsu's dimensions. For example, you could leave an island of normal ground at the center for yourself, or a narrow path for you and your allies to run through, forming a chokepoint. This does allow you to shrink the total affected area, if you wish. 

Alternately, you may use form the 'swamp' in the form of a line up to 200 yards long and 100 yards across, oriented in any fashion.

#### --( Sando no Jutsu - Mountain Earth Technique )--
The user creates two monolithic walls up from the ground, destroying the environment for several hundred yards in either direction, and sends them at one another. As they approach each other, their momentum builds, starting off slow and ending with a collision that removes the third dimension from anything unlucky enough to be caught between them.

 - Chakra: 45
 - Damage: 50d20*1
 - Range: 100
 - Area: 80
 - Speed: 30, Delay 30
 - Seal Speed: 26
 - Tags: Blunt, Area of Effect, Projectile

Effects: This technique has +100% Wounding. If it does cause a wound, it also causes two wounds of the next lower severity, three of the severity below that, and so forth. Thus, if it inflicted a Critical Wound, it would also inflict two Severes, three Majors, and four Minors. You may reduce Sando's speed below its Delay, though you can not abort Sando once you have declared its use, as the massive walls of earth build and rush into one another.

#### --( Chidoukaku - Moving Earth Core )--
The user lowers or raises the ground in the surrounding area at high speed, creating giant depressions or spires. Despite how this might seem, it's fairly harmless to the surrounding area. People, plants, and buildings on the affected area will be largely undisturbed. The sides of the hole or spire are quite sturdy, and it's not in danger of collapsing on its own.

 - Chakra: 20+X
 - Special: Interrupt (uh, yeah, good luck with that)
 - Speed: 24
 - Seal Speed: 30

Effects: This affects everything in a square of up to 50 yards on a side, centered on its user. It moves the ground in that area X*(damage bonus) yards straight up, or straight down. If you manage to use this as an interrupt, this will allow you to avoid a technique if you move yourself out of its range.
