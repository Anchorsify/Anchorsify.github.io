## E-Rank
#### --( Rashinban no Jutsu - Compass Technique )--
It's about what it sounds like. The user channels lightning elemental chakra into a needle, or kunai, or similar-sized and -shaped object, which will then, when laid flat (sometimes requiring a few taps to help it along) point towards magnetic north.

 - Chakra: 5
 - Speed: 4
 - Seal Speed: 12

Effects: Allows a single kunai or senbon to be used as a compass for 6 hours or until used in an attack. It's not quite perfect, but it's good enough for most uses.

#### --( Shougeki Heki - Shocking Burst )--
Holding a hand out there is a pulse of electricity. This isn't nearly enough to kill anyone, but it definitely hurts.

 - Chakra: 10
 - Damage: 1d6*1d4
 - Area: 10
 - Speed: 4
 - Seal Speed: 6
 - Status: Shock 2 for 20 IC

Effects: This technique may not have its Speed reduced below 4 by any means. It can either target a single person, or everyone within the range as an area centered on, but not affecting, you. If the latter, it does not penalize dodges as a regular Area of Effect would.

#### --( Raikyuu - Lightning Ball )--
Charging up electricity between two weapons, you harness it into a ball and then fire it at your enemies, the ball exploding out once it makes contact with anything.

 - Chakra: 8
 - Damage: 1d6*2d4
 - Accuracy: +1
 - Range: 10
 - Speed: 9
 - Requires: a metal weapon in each hand.

## D-rank
#### --( Shuurai - Lightning Strike )--
You focus energy to the tips of your fingers on either hand, then point at an opponent, releasing a reasonably sized bolt of electricity. This is nothing like real lightning, but it looks similar!

 - Chakra: 14
 - Damage: 2d6*4d4
 - Range: 15
 - Speed: 13
 - Seal Speed: 10
 - Status: Paralysis 2 for 20 IC

Effects: If you target someone who is affected by a Raiton-based Paralysis status with this technique, it gains +1 Accuracy.

#### --( Juude - Electric Charge )--
By charging oneself with Raiton chakra, the user can exploit the lingering charge on an opponent and use the aligned chakra to gravitate toward their target, making their next attack harder to evade.

 - Chakra: +8
 - Speed: +4

Effects: This technique is used as a link to any unarmed or combo jutsu or unarmed basic attack, and only has an affect if the target of the attack it's added to has the Shock status. Juude immediately ends that status (which then doesn't apply to, or penalize, their defensive interrupt in response to the attack), and grants you +X Accuracy to the attack, where X is the Shock status you ended on them, to a maximum of 3.  This works only against those suffering from a Raiton-based Shock status effect, and has no effect on other, non-Raiton sources of Shock.

#### --( Jinrai no Jutsu - Thunderclap Technique )--
The user puts both hands together, forming a miniature thunder bolt between his hands, splitting the air and forming an extremely loud BANG, which is rather startling when your a few inches from it, and not expecting it. It has the added benefits of temporarily deafening the opponent.

 - Chakra: 14
 - Area: 10
 - Speed: 12
 - Seal Speed: 10

Effects: Everyone in range (except you) is inflicted with a Stun (8+the amount they failed by) if they fail a status roll, during which time they're considered deafened, losing all ranks of the Enhanced Hearing ability, as well as any abilities based upon it (namely Blind Fighting and Genjutsu Awareness) for the duration. Victims of this technique gain +3 to the Resistance roll for every time they've defended against it in the same battle.

#### --( Shinkei Attou no Jutsu - Nerve Overloading Technique )--
You send a 'spark' of chakra into an enemy, stimulating any electrical chakra already in their system and sending them into several seconds of agonizing convulsions.

 - Chakra: 15
 - Range: 10
 - Speed: 10
 - Seal Speed: 8

Effects: This technique has an Accuracy bonus equal to the target's Paralysis severity (Para 3 = +3 Accuracy), removes the target's Shock status and inflicts a Stun equal to 4*(the Shock severity removed), up to a maximum of Stun 20.  This technique only works off of Raiton-induced Paralysis and Shock status effects.

#### --( Kyousou Ikazuchi no Jutsu - Racing Thunder Technique )--
By pumping your legs full of lightning chakra, you raise your muscle's response time, and their power as well. Unfortunately, this is all focused in just your legs.

 - Chakra: 15
 - Upkeep: 2
 - Speed: 8
 - Seal Speed: 8

Effects: Your AGI is treated as 25% higher for the purposes of movement. Additionally, you may choose to declare a Speed X move action, to a maximum of CHA/10. Unlike normal movement (which is handled on an IC-by-IC basis), the movement for this action is resolved immediately. However, moving this way has a Chakra cost equal to (the number of yards travelled)/2. Like normal movement, you may not reduce this action's Speed by spending AP.

#### --( Kaminari no Yaiba - Lightning Blade )--
With a quick burst of lightning natured chakra, you force it through a metallic weapon and into your enemy, usually during some sort of attack. This is a burst of energy, rather than a proper chakra flow technique.

 - Chakra: +13
 - Speed: +4
 - Requires: Melee weapon

Effects: This technique acts as a link to any melee weapon attack, allowing it to bypass half of its target(s) Damage Reduction, as well as adding one-third your NDB to its damage. The attack is defended against as both a Weapon Taijutsu attack and a Raiton technique (for determining the efficacy of jutsu-based defenses), which overrides any and all other elements that the weapon might otherwise have (such as those with an active Chakra Flow).  

This technique can not be used with any sort of weapon created by a ninjutsu element other than Raiton.

#### --( Raisen - Lightning Flash )--
The ranged variant of Kaminari, Raisen charges a metallic thrown weapon with Raiton chakra that crackles and sparks along the edges of the weapon mid-flight, giving it enhanced cutting power and debilitating anyone hit.

 - Chakra: +11
 - Speed:  +(4 + weapons thrown/4)
 - Requires: Large or Small Thrown Weapon(s)
 - Status: X Paralysis for 20 IC

Effects: This technique acts as a link to any thrown weapon attack, and allows the attack to bypass half the damage reduction of those hit by it.  The attack is defended against  X is equal to the amount your Accuracy beats your opponent's defensive roll by, to a maximum of 3. Against defenses which are not rolled, or if the opponent elects not to defend, the maximum Paralysis is inflicted.

## C-Rank
#### --( Jinraisen - Thunderclap Arrow )--
By charging up a mass of electricity around one's hand, they can throw it as a destructive (but volatile) arc of raiton chakra that vaguely resembles an arrowhead-like shape, hence the name. It can't travel nearly as far as an actual arrow, but can inflict high damage to anything it strikes.

 - Chakra: 21
 - Damage: 2d10*3d4
 - Range: 20
 - Speed: 16
 - Seal Speed: 12
 - Status: Shock 3 for 30 IC.

#### --( Kanden Satsujin - Electric Murder )--
You hold out your palms toward the enemy and discharge huge amounts of lightning chakra, searing the flesh of your enemy.

 - Chakra: 17
 - Damage: 40d2
 - Accuracy: +2
 - Range: 10
 - Speed: 14
 - Seal Speed: 16

Effects: If this is the last technique you used which required handseals, it does not require handseals.

If this technique is used consecutively, with no other non-interrupt actions between uses, its Chakra cost is increased by 1 for each use, and you add half the damage of all previous consecutive uses for the purpose of determining wounds. For example, say you dealt 100, then 120, then 150 damage with it: This would deal a total of ( 100 + 120 + 150 ) 370 damage, but for determining if you wounded your opponent, the first technique would be treated as 100 damage, the second as (120 + 100/2) 170, and the third as (150 + (100+120)/2) 260 for determining wounds.

#### --( Kangekiha - Wave of Inspiration )--
Focusing a great amount of lightning chakra into their hands the user then places them on or near something that will conduct the attack into their opponent. Be it something meta something wet, or whatever, as long as there is a conductive material, there will be a target who is hit!

 - Chakra: 21
 - Damage: 2d8*5d4
 - Accuracy: -4
 - Range: 30
 - Speed: 10 + Delay Special
 - Seal Speed: 16

Effects: You can use this technique as soon as you complete the necessary seals, or 'hold' it with a variable-speed Delay, to a maximum of your CHA/10. 

Used by itself, this technique has +4 to its Accuracy and Damage Bonus if used on someone hit by a Suiton technique within the past 5 IC. This bonus is reduced by 1 per 5 IC it's been since they were hit by a Suiton technique, to +0 Accuracy and Damage Bonus if it's been more than 20 IC.

Alternatively, you may choose to target a Suiton technique used by someone else by acting simultaneously (on the same IC) to enhance their technique, causing Raiton chakra to flow throughout the water. In this case, this technique does not have any Accuracy associated with it, and hits only if the Suiton technique hits. If it does, you combine the damages for both techniques before applying any sort of reductions to its damage, but deal Wounds of one category lower (to a minimum of minor), and inflict an Energy wound in addition to the normal type of wound the Suiton would inflict. Because of the combination of elements, Suiton's normal weakness to Doton is negated (and it's considered neutral against Doton), but retains its strength to Katon, and against other elemental defenses is considered a Suiton or Raiton technique, whichever is more beneficial.

#### --( Taiyoken - Solar Flare )--
Blinds opponents who don't know to close their eyes. Not affected by doujutsu which bypass visibility penalties, and may in fact temporarily shut them down.

 - Chakra: 17
 - Range: 12
 - Speed: 8
 - Seal Speed: 10

Effects: When you use this technique, you and anyone in range make an opposed Initiative roll, with the victims getting a +4 bonus for each previous time this technique has been used in the current battle. If you beat their roll, they're blinded; if not, they managed to close their eyes in time.

Anyone who is blinded is inflicted with a -8 Visibility Penalty which fades at a rate of 1 per 5 IC, and temporarily loses all ranks of the Enhanced Sight ability, as well as those dependent on it (namely Keen Senses, Assassin's Eye and Genjutsu Awareness). Anyone with an active Doujutsu reduces their bonus to successive rolls against this technique to only +2, and if they fail, they lose all benefits of their doujutsu. Both ability ranks and doujutsu effects remain suppressed until the Visibility Penalty from this technique has been reduced to -3.

#### --( Chuubu Gaki no Jutsu - Ghoul Paralysis Technique )--
After making contact with an enemy, you send a powerful pulse of electricity through their body, momentarily overstimulating their nervous system. For several seconds afterwards, the recipient of the shock will find their body sluggish and poorly responsive. While not actual harmful, this is exceptionally painful.

 - Chakra: 15
 - Range: Touch
 - Speed: 12
 - Seal Speed: 10
 - Status: Shock 4 for 20 IC

Effects: This inflicts Paralysis 4 for 40 IC.

for If you hit with this technique (using your Taijutsu accuracy to touch your target), you inflict a Shock 4, and if they fail a status roll, they're inflicted with Paralysis 4. If they already have either status, they have their existing status increased by 2, instead.

#### --( Fukushuu Kaminarikami - Avenging Lightning God )--
You divert your chakra to surge across your skin, building up something akin to a strong static charge. Unlike actual static electricity, this is incredibly dangerous.

 - Chakra: 23
 - Upkeep: 6
 - Damage: 3d6*2d4
 - Speed: 8
 - Seal Speed: 14
 - Special: This technique receives only half your damage bonus.
 - Status: Paralysis 1 for 40 IC, Special

Effects: Any time you are struck by an unarmed melee attack or metallic melee weapon, this technique 'discharges', dealing its damage to them automatically, along with the above status roll.  If they hit you again while still suffering from the Paralysis of this technique, its severity is increased by 1, but its duration is not refreshed.

This technique can be negated by effects which state they prevent on-contact effects, but will counter (and is not stopped by) Doryu Ken.

## B-Rank
#### --( Raijuu Hashiri no Jutsu - Lightning Beast Running Technique )--
Charging both your hands with a powerful electric current, you slam them together and expel a creature made of pure lightning, in whatever form you choose (one of a realistic, quadripedal animal). The beast then runs at your enemy, connected to your hands by a lightning 'leash' that allows you to redirect the attack if an enemy defends against it.

 - Chakra: 35
 - Damage: 4d10*3d4
 - Range: 25
 - Speed: 14
 - Seal Speed: 20
 - Status: Paralysis 4 for 40 IC

Effects: After seeing the result of your opponent's defense, you may choose to make them reroll it. If you do this, they keep the second result (even if it's better). If you use this option, Raijuu Hashiri's damage is halved for the purpose of determining wounds, and it loses its ability to inflict Paralysis. You may also use the redirect to send the beast after a different target; it still suffers the usual reductions this way.

#### --( Raiton Bunshin no Jutsu - Lightning Release Clone Technique )--
This technique creates a powerful, not-quite-fully independent copy of yourself. They're capable of bringing substantial force to bear in combat, but lack enough physical cohesion to survive being hit. Of course, striking a ball of animated lightning tends to be bad for one's health.

- Chakra: 20, +5 per clone
- Damage: 100*1d2
- Speed: 8, +4 per clone
- Seal Speed: 12, +4 per clone
- Requires: Bunshin no Jutsu

Effects: You can create up to two clones. Anyone who destroys a Lightning Clone with a melee attack takes this technique's damage automatically. These function like regular bunshin, except that they have (and pay for) their own Fatigue costs, and may perform the following additional actions:

 - [ X AP ] Move: Your clones can move, with X being half the speed of the Move action they take.
 - [ X AP ] Basic Unarmed: A basic unarmed attack, using your attributes. X is half the Speed of the attack.
 - [ X AP ] Basic Weapon: You may transfer any number of weapons to your Raiton Bunshin when you create them. They may attack with those weapons, using your abilities. X is half the Speed of the attack.
 - [ X AP ] Multi-Throw: Should be self-explanatory. X is half the Speed of the multi-throw.
 - [ X AP ] Raiton Ninjutsu: The clone must first perform the handseals, at the regular speed, costing AP equal to half the technique's modified Seal Speed. It then costs X AP, where X is half the technique's Speed.


#### --( Gian - False Darkness )--
After completing the handseals the user forms a large, spear shaped bolt of lightning which can be directed at distant targets. One of this technique's advantages is its ability to be used in rapid succession, allowing for rapid long-range bombardment.

 - Chakra: 30
 - Damage: 75*1d6
 - Range: 50
 - Speed: 15
 - Seal Speed: 25

Effects: Once the technique's seals have been completed, you may repeatedly use Gian without forming handseals as long as you take no other ninjutsu action. Thus, you could dodge, and throw a punch, but not use a ninjutsu-based defense.

#### --( Shichuu Shibari - Four Pillar Bind )--
Four pillars of rock, each about twenty feet tall, are summoned around an enemy (don't ask how that works for a lightning jutsu). Lightning arcs between the pillars, flooding the area with electricity. While the damage done by this technique is fairly mild, it can easily immobilize someone within the area.

 - Chakra: 33
 - Upkeep: 4
 - Range: 40
 - Area: 20 x 20 square
 - Speed: 20
 - Seal Speed: 20

Effects: This technique applies Paralysis 2, Shock 2, and Immobilize 2 to everyone within its area, and every IC someone remains in the area they take 4 damage which bypasses all reductions. This damage does not benefit from the technique's Speed or your NDB, and ends immediately upon leaving the area (as do the status effects).

The pillars can be attacked, and each have 100+(NDB*5) HP, with CHA/2 DR, and do not take additional damage from Raiton (despite the fact that they're pillars of earth...); only one pillar needs to be destroyed in order to end this technique.

#### --( Tesura Karui - Tesla Minor )--
This generates a semi-stable mass of lightning chakra which you can physically throw. It'll 'stick' to the first surface it comes into contact with (reminder: people are not surfaces). Once placed the ball is stationary, a bright and crackling hemisphere of chakra. Anyone unfortunate enough to wander into range will receive a face-full of electricity.

 - Chakra: 31
 - Upkeep: 4
 - Damage: 100
 - Range: 30
 - Speed: 20
 - Seal Speed: 22
 - Status: Shock 4 for 20 IC

Effects: This creates a ball of energy within range on some surface. When it's created, and every 25 IC afterwards, the ball emits bolts of lightning at everyone within CHA /2 yards. Each bolt of a lightning is a separate attack. The ball has 10 'charges'; it can attack 10 times, and then it expires. It will not attack you, and you can specify up to (Chakra Control)/10 other people who it will ignore, but it otherwise discharges against everyone within range.

When it attacks someone, it uses the final Speed of the technique when it was first used, and its effective NDB is equal to yours at the time you use the technique. Because the attacks are made by the technique, and not you, you cannot modify them further (such as with Willpower or AP). Anyone hit by it who fails a status roll is inflicted with Shock 4.

The ball can be attacked, and is destroyed if it takes 250 damage; Melee attacks against it cause it to discharge against the attacker automatically. This technique uses your base Accuracy for an B-rank Raiton, unmodified by status, wounds, temporary bonuses, and so on, though penalties from Fatigue do apply, with a +1 to its Accuracy for every time it has discharged against the same person, calculated separately per person.

#### --( Hiyaku Raikoui - Chain Lightning )--
You hold out your fingers and fire a focused bolt of lightning which then, after striking the target, goes to find a new target, then another, amplifying itself each time it passes through someone, 'feeding' off of their chakra.

 - Chakra: 37
 - Damage: 7d6*1d10
 - Range: 50
 - Speed: 18
 - Seal Speed: 18
 - Status: Shock 4 for 40 IC

Effects: This technique has an Accuracy bonus equal to the Shock status of anyone it targets, and it jumps to another target of your choice within half its normal range (from the first target, not you) if it hits, gaining +1 to its Accuracy and +10% to its damage, jumping to hit a maximum of (NDB) targets, none of which can be hit more than once by this technique.

## A-Rank
#### --( Kouken Rairyuu - Guardian Lightning Dragon )--
Harnessing a great amount of chakra, you create a field of lightning that swirls around you and coalesces into the crackling outline of an electric dragon. From there you can keep it at the ready, or attack an unfortunate foe immediately.

 - Chakra: 49
 - Damage: 5d8*6d6
 - Range: 30
 - Speed: 20
 - Seal Speed: 24
 - Status: Paralysis 8 for 50 IC

Effects: When you use this technique, you may choose to lower its Chakra cost by 10. If you do so, rather than launching at your opponents the lightning dragon takes shape coiling around you. It will automatically attack the first person to move within 10 yards of you (it will not, however, trigger this effect if you move closer to them), with +4 Accuracy. You may also launch the dragon at any time while it's still around, as a Chakra 25, Speed 16 action, using 16 rather than 20 as its base Speed.

#### --( Tenchu - Wrath of Heaven )--
This technique earns its name. As the handseals are completed electricity will begin to arc along the user's body and wisps of dark smoke will rise from them, a result of the overwhelming, uncontainable amounts of chakra this jutsu requires. That chakra is converted directly into electricity and released in a blast every bit as devastatingly powerful as a genuine bolt of lightning.

 - Chakra: 60
 - Damage: 5d8 * 5d6 * 2d4.takeHighest(1)
 - Range: 100
 - Area: 10
 - Speed: 30
 - Seal Speed: 40

Effects: This hits everything in a line ten yards across (its area), and up to one hundred yards long (i.e. anything between the user and the max range). The effectiveness of partial defense is doubled against this technique: for every 1 point it hits by, it deals 10% damage. Any one hit by it who fails a Status roll takes a Shock and Paralysis status of a severity equal to how much they failed by, to a maximum of 10, for 30 IC. After rolling damage for Tenchu, you may spend a point of Willpower to reroll it and take the higher of the two results. This may only be done once per attack, and only if you did not spend Willpower to improve Tenchu's Accuracy.

#### --( Juurokuchuu Shibari - Sixteen Pillar Bind )--
Just as the four pillar bind, this surrounds the area, though this time it's a bit more solid. After creating a large, oven-like structure it then electrocutes the entire area inside, frying the contents and hopefully making it hard for them to escape.

 - Chakra: 44
 - Upkeep: 8
 - Range: 120
 - Area: 80
 - Speed: 24
 - Seal Speed: 32

Effects: This is a 20 x 20 AoE, inside a 40 x 40, inside a 60 x 60, inside a 80 x 80; thus, it's 20 yards from the edge of one layer to the next. For each layer a person is inside they suffer Paralysis 1, Shock 1, and Immobilize 1, and takes 4 damage every IC which bypasses all reductions. This damage does not benefit from the technique's Speed or your NDB, and ends immediately upon leaving the area (as do the status effects).

The pillars can be attacked, and each have 250+(NDB*10) HP, with CHA/2 DR, and do not take additional damange from Raiton (despite the fact that they're huge earthen pillars). Only one pillar of each set of four needs to be destroyed to end the effects of that layer.

#### --( Tesura Shousa - Tesla Major )--
Filling both of your arms with an intense and energetic lightning chakra, you throw it out onto a surface. This time, instead of a small ball being produced as in Tesla Minor there is a great spire of electricity that stays in place, pulsating with energy. These usually tower over a battlefield and electrocute anything that comes within range.

 - Chakra: 45
 - Upkeep: 8
 - Damage: 250
 - Range: 60
 - Speed: 24
 - Seal Speed: 28
 - Status: Paralysis 4 for 20 IC

Effects: The creates a vertical spire of energy on an appropriate surface, CHA/4 yards tall. When created, and every 20 IC afterwards, this shocks anyone except you within (CHA)*3/4 yards. You may designate up to (Chakra Control)/5 other people who will not be targeted by the spire, but everyone else within range who is not hidden will be targetted. This attack receives an Accuracy bonus equal to half the severity of the Paralysis status on its target(s) (meaning that different people may have to defend against different accuracies).

When it attacks someone, it uses the final Speed of the technique when it was first used, and its effective NDB is equal to yours at the time you use the technique. Because the attacks are made by the technique, and not you, you cannot modify them further (such as with Willpower or AP).

The spire has an unlimited number of charges, and 1000+NDB*25 HP. It takes double damage from Fuuton, half from Doton, and if struck by a melee-range attack it immediately discharges against the attacker.

You may 'store' uses of Tesla Minor in the spire, up to a maximum of CHA/20, by using Tesla Minor and targetting the spire created by Tesla Major. These will all discharge at the same time as the spire, gaining its range but keeping their own damage. This technique uses your base Accuracy for an A-rank Raiton unmodified by status, wounds, temporary bonuses, and so on, though penalties from Fatigue do apply.

#### --( Raitama - Ball Lightning )--
Upon completion of the handseals the user forms a ball of raw, condensed lightning chakra between their palms, then encases it in a more stable 'shell' made from hundreds of interwoven chakra strands, creating a mesh-like barrier that prevents the inner chakra from dissipating. After that, they can either leave the resulting ball of chakra hovering where it was made or hide it inside some appropriately sized physical object, typically the ground, where it will lie in wait until someone comes close enough to trigger the mine. When they do, it seeks them out and detonates on contact.

 - Chakra: 40
 - Upkeep: 6
 - Damage: 300
 - Range: 60
 - Speed: 30
 - Seal Speed: 30

Effects: The mine must be placed within melee range. The technique's actual range can, if you wish, be set lower than 60. Whenever someone other than you enters this range, they immediately become the target of a Sneak Attack from this technique; the ball of lightning soars towards them without warning.

This can be left sitting in the opponent (as an effective deterrent), or submerged into any available surface (the floor, the walls). If you are within the maximum range (even if you reduced the attack range), you can prevent the ball from activating by concentrating on it (though you'd typically need line of sight to know if this is necessary). If this is hidden inside some object, it cannot be detected without the use of a chakra-detecting doujutsu (such as Byakugan).

#### --( Shimeshi Ryouiki - Dampening Field )--
Concentrating your chakra, you project an invisible, wide area dome of chakra. Maintaining its stability requires you to stay practically immobile at its center, but the effects are virtually impossible to circumvent without finding the originator. Anyone who enters the field will instantly notice its presence--their hair will start to stand on end, and most objects will begin building a static charge.

 - Chakra: 41
 - Upkeep: 12
 - Area: CHA
 - Speed: 20
 - Seal Speed: 34

Effects: You can move up to CHA/10 yards from your original location while maintaining this technique; moving (or being forcibly moved) any further causes it to end. Within the field, all chakra-based sensing (such as chakra-sensory ninja, and the Yurokensei technique) has a -20 penalty, and Doujutsu outright fail to function (i.e., they give none of their normal benefits). Electronic and electrical devices in this area are additionally useless. The dampening also interferes with other lightning-based chakra, reducing the damage of all Raiton in its Area by 20%, and the large amounts of ambient lightning chakra interferes with earth-based chakra, reducing the damage of Doton by 25% and increasing their Chakra costs and Upkeeps (if relevant) by 5.
