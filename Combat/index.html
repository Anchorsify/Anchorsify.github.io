From there, everyone is assigned a number depending upon the highest rolled initiative, working backwards to determine when people who rolled lower act.</p> <p>Everyone subtracts their roll from the person who rolled the highest; this is the initiative count they will act on.</p> <blockquote> <p>Choji, Shikamaru, and Ino are all preparing to fight, and so they roll initiative. Choji scores a 6, Shikamaru a 16, and Ino a 12. They will act on the following initiative counts: Choji: 16 - 6 = 10 Shikamaru: 16 - 16 = 0 Ino: 16 - 12 = 4</p> </blockquote> <h4 id="flow-of-time">Flow of Time</h4> <p>Combat begins on Initiative Count 0 (as shown by the example above), or “Init 0”, or simply “IC 0”. Players act whenever their initiative count is reached.</p> <p>Every action a player can take has a given Speed associated with it. When they take an action, its effects are resolved immediately, and its Speed is added to their current initiative count; that is when they will be able to act again.</p> <p>Some effects may lower an action’s Speed. No matter how many such effects are applied, no action’s Speed may ever go below half its original value, rounded up, and no action’s Speed can be reduced below 3. This does mean that an action with a base Speed of 3 or lower may not have its Speed decreased at all.</p> <h4 id="simultaneous-actions">Simultaneous Actions</h4> <p>If two people act on the same initiative count, both of their actions are declared and resolved simultaneously. Thus, you and your opponent will both fully declare and resolve your attacks (you can take turns doing so, for the sake of convenience), but not apply their effects until after you’ve both done so, at the very end of the IC.</p> <p>Blocking is a partial exception. If you were blocking when your turn came up, and you choose to block again as your simultaneous action, it takes priority; that is to say, you may use Block as a defense against an attack delivered on the same IC, under those circumstances.</p> <h4 id="action-points">Action Points</h4> <p>One of the things that makes battles dramatic is one or both sides pulling out sudden, unpredicted surprises, and among shinobi that’s par for the course. Mechanically, this is represented by “Action Points”; thematically this can be a burst of adrenaline, or the result of you carefully luring your opponent into just the right position for you to counter-attack.</p> <p>Everyone gains 5 AP every time the Initiative Count reaches a multiple of 20. You start the battle with zero, and can have up to a maximum of AGI/2.</p> <p>You can spend AP whenever you take an action. Each AP spent reduces the action’s Speed by 1.</p> <h4 id="combat-example">Combat Example</h4> <p>It may help if you read the Actions section of this chapter before reading this example.</p> <p>Using the example above, we had Shikamaru acting on IC 0, Ino on 4, and Choji on 10. Shikamaru spends his first action attacking Choji with a Speed 8 punch, meaning he’ll act next on IC 8.</p> <blockquote> <p>To defend himself, Choji tries to dodge, though fails to do so. He’s hit, and takes damage, but dodging pushed his next action back by 2, putting his next action on 12.</p> <p>Ino goes next, and begins forming handseals for a potent ninjutsu technique. It has a Seal Speed of 14, meaning she’ll be ready to act on IC (4 + 14 =) 18.</p> <p>Shikamaru goes again, and uses a simple taijutsu technique with a speed of 12. Choji tries to dodge again, this time evading successfully. Shikamaru’s next action will be on IC 20 (8+12), and Choji’s on IC 14 (12+2, because he dodged).</p> <p>Choji’s taking a bit of a beating, but Shikamaru’s not hitting hard. He’s worried about what Ino might be planning, though (she only had to declare that she was using a Perform Handseals action, not what jutsu it was for), so he disengages and rushes his other teammate, unleashing a powerful taijutsu technique with a speed of 20. Not wanting to take that kind of hit, Ino tries to dodge, and fails.</p> <p>Ino has to make a Chakra Control skill check against the damage of Choji’s attack divided by 10, plus an additional 10. She rolls very well, and manages to succeed; had she failed, she would’ve automatically aborted her handseals action, meaning her next action would be on IC 15 (the attack happened on IC 14, +1 = 15), and if she wanted to use that technique she’d need to start over.</p> <p>Choji’s next action won’t come until IC 34 (14+20), whereas Ino’s jutsu has been delayed until IC 20 (18+2).</p> <p>IC 20 comes up, and Shikamaru and Ino are both ready to go. It’s too late for Shikamaru to do anything about Ino’s jutsu; she’s already completed the handseals, and this turn she’ll be able to use it. Worse yet, he doesn’t know if she’ll be targeting him or Choji.</p> <p>If he’d had a little more time–for example, if he’d used a quicker move in place of the taijutsu technique he utilized last–he could declare a Block of a speed that would expire some time after Ino’s action, allowing him to reliably defend himself if she chose to target him.</p> <p>That’s not an option, so he goes for a quick punch at her (not wanting to make the same mistake as last time, that’ll give him plenty of opportunity to prepare before Choji’s next action). Ino uses her technique, a Speed 6 ninjutsu. Both try to dodge the other’s technique.</p> <p>This means that Shikamaru will act on IC (20+8+2) 30, Ino on (20+6+2) 28, and Choji on 34.</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="actions">Actions</h2> <h2 id="advanced-actions">Advanced Actions</h2> <h2 id="stealth">Stealth</h2> <h2 id="pursuit">Pursuit</h2> <h2 id="conditions-and-status-effects">Conditions and Status Effects</h2> <h2 id="weather-conditions">Weather Conditions</h2> <h2 id="wounds">Wounds</h2> <h2 id="recovery">Recovery</h2> <p><strong>Naruto World</strong> is a homebrew game system taking elements from several other systems (Exalted, d20, etc) to create a unique play experience for a game set in the world of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naruto" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Naruto</a>, a shonen manga created by Masashi Kishimoto.
