At the same time, monkeys are also known to be belligerent and irreverent, and prone to causing mischief when it suits them… which is just as true about their more intelligent, chakra-wielding counterparts.</p> <p>Shinobi who form a contract with the monkeys need only a great deal of patience, but a healthy appreciation for satire and an ability to laugh at their own misfortunes (of which there will likely be quite a few) are necessary to avoid going mad with frustration.</p> <p>What sets monkeys apart from most of the counterparts is that they’re capable of performing actual ninjutsu, complete with handseals. Not all of them can, and they don’t have as wide a variety of techniques as actual shinobi, but it’s still quite an impressive accomplishment compared to other animals (having human-like hands helps, no doubt).</p> <p>The Avatar of the monkeys is the legendary Monkey King Enma, known to command a great deal of respect even from the avatars of other summonable species–other than the Queen of Spiders, Tsuchigumo, with whom he has a longstanding enmity. Among his more famous traits is his ability to transform into the Adamantime Staff, a legendary weapon said to be without equal.</p> <h2 id="access">Access</h2> <ul> <li>800 XP: Monkey Messenger</li> <li>1200 XP: The Threefold Tools of the Monkey</li> <li>1600 XP: Summon: Partner Monkey</li> <li>2000 XP: Substitution Monkey</li> <li>2400 XP: Three Great Monkey Statues</li> <li>2500 XP: Summon: Handsome Monkey Prince</li> <li>4000 XP: Summon: Pillar-Supporting Monkey</li> <li>6000 XP: Summon: Monkey King Enma</li> </ul> <h2 id="techniques">Techniques</h2> <h4 id="-saru-tsukai---monkey-messenger-">–( Saru Tsukai - Monkey Messenger )–</h4> <p>A small capuchin monkey dressed in a suit appears before the summoner. He bows politely, and usually follows that up with something bothersome, such as throwing a rock at a bystander, poking someone in the leg with a stick, baring his hindquarters at his summoner, or some other form of mostly harmless message. Having done so, the monkey then waits to be a given a message. The monkey can carry any small written document, or even recite a verbal message–though it’s best to be wary of the latter. While the monkey will faithfully and accurately deliver all the information, he’ll also add plenty of extra insults (directed at both the recipient and the summoner).</p> <p>As a messenger, Tsukai is reliable in the sense that eventually he’ll deliver whatever he was supposed to, and he’s incredibly hard to catch. On the other hand, he can be far slower than most animal–for that matter, most human– messengers, given his propensity for taking ‘breaks’ and slacking off for upwards of a week at a time.</p> <p>Once the message is delivered, Tsukai will ‘inform’ the summoner of this in the form of a prank–usually getting something shoved down the back of their pants or having a banana thrown at the back of their head, before the monkey vanishes. Now, if only he’d put that talent to use in delivering his messages.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 20</li> <li>Speed: 15</li> <li>Seal Speed: 10</li> <li>Requires: Kuchiyose no Jutsu</li> </ul> <p>Effects: The monkey can carry a trio of normal-sized scrolls, or any similar-sized objects–or even a small knapsack or other container (meaning it’s not limited to just messages), and will bring it to a destination or person of your choice. If a person, you must tell the monkey where to look for them.</p> <p>In combat the monkey hides after receiving the message, with a prodigious stealth bonus of +40. After hiding the monkey will proceed to run away at a speed of 3 yards every IC. If attacked it defends with a +20 to dodge, and has 100 Vitality.</p> <p>Message delivery time is inconsistent at best, thanks to Tsukai’s nature. No matter the distance he’s sent (within the shinobi nations), the message takes 3d10 days to be delivered. This has nothing to do with difficulty getting there, and everything to do with Tsukai getting distracted and slacking off whenever he pleases, regardless of how important his task may be.</p> <p>More than a few summoners are annoyed by Tsukai’s unreliability, but, well… what can you do?</p> <h4 id="-sarusanbaigu---the-threefold-tools-of-the-monkey-">–( Sarusanbaigu - The Threefold Tools of the Monkey )–</h4> <p>A long time ago, there actually were three tools, each with three abilities. Its was a catchy name, and accurate! Over time the monkeys picked up more tools, but haven’t seen any reason to change the technique’s name. A summoner trying to explain to them that it should be changed will be treated as if stupid by whichever monkey he happens to be speaking to. Really, it’s best to just not bring the subject up.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 15</li> <li>Speed: 10</li> <li>Seal Speed: 10</li> </ul> <p>Effects: This summons a single item from the list below. Unlike most summoning techniques, there is no direct limitation on how often you may perform this one. However, each of the tools has its own duration (how long it will stay around before vanishing in a puff of smoke, even if you were busy using it), and its own amount of time you must wait before summoning that particular tool again.</p> <p>This does mean that you could, if you needed, summon all five of the tools one after another in a single situation. Each of the tools can be targeted even if you’re carrying it (treated as a called shot). They have 100 Vitality and 100 DR, and vanish when their Vitality reaches 0.</p> <p><strong>Kinaikagi - Golden Skeleton Key</strong><br> An ornate (really, gaudy) golden key with a handle sculpted to resemble the face of a monkey, complete with two small ruby eyes, and two prongs shaped like miniature grasping monkey arms, with the keys of teeth being the monkey’s fingers. Curiously, it is able to fit keyholes of any size, though getting it to actually open the locks takes a bit of work.</p> <p>The key functions as a +5 set of lockpicks that is always completely silent and never breaks. Additionally, it can be thrown at a lock within STR/4 yards. Using it this way requires an Espionage roll to “pick” the lock without the normal +5 bonus, as well as an Accuracy roll needing a (20 + 1 per yard the lock is away) to actually hit the lock. If successful, whatever was being targeted is immediately unlocked–though the key must be retrieved (or unsummoned). The golden key can be summoned for up to an hour, once every month (4 OOC days).</p> <p><strong>Saruhisa - The Monkey’s Gourd</strong><br> A small but highly polished and lacquered calabash gourd with a cap at the top and a bright scarlet rope to secure it to one’s belt, the monkey’s gourd doens’t look like it should be able to hold more than half a gallon of liquid. Sometimes, it holds less; other times, it holds… much, much more. When summoned, the user can choose one of three liquids for the gourd to be filled with: water, sake, or an elixir. Regardles, the gourd can be summoned once a week (OOC day).</p> <p><em>Water</em> - The small gourd actually contains 20 gallons of water that can be used in jutsu, or for any normal purpose. The gourd lasts for 1 hour and can be refilled, but anything other than water put into it will curiously spill out despite the holder’s best efforts.</p> <p><em>Sake</em> - Possibly a good reason to sign the monkey contract on its own, the gourd can pour out what amounts to one shot of sake every minute for 12 hours straight. After taking a drink (Speed 5) the user has to make a Resistance roll against 10 + 1 per drink after the first. Failure leaves them at a -1 penalty to Accuracy and skill rolls, stacking with itself. It’s not all bad, though, as they gain a DR equal to the number of drinks they’ve had. This lasts for one hour per drink, and after it wears off leaves the most incredible, devastating, world ending hangover any human is likely to experience.</p> <p><em>Elixir</em> - Supposedly a magical elixir, maybe just a special mixture of drugs. The elixir is meant for consumption by monkeys (who often face retribution for their mischevious pranks), but works for humans as well. Taking a drink (a Speed 10 action) allows a Resistance roll with a +2 against any status you’re currently afflicted by which originally allowed one, against the original difficulty.</p> <p>This only works against things requiring a status roll, and negates only the penalties caused from failing. Succeeding against a poison would end its effect entirely, while succeeding against Dragon Fire Technique would lower the Burns and Ignite by half their original severity; any damage already taken (or similar) is not undone.</p> <p>The elixir lasts for 50 IC. Passing it on to someone else is a Speed 5 action.</p> <p><strong>Gentou - Magic Lantern</strong><br> An ornate golden lantern; the top and bottom are in the shape of hexagonal cones, and the body has six gold-framed glass faces, with golden designs of monkeys engaged in various activities inlaid in the glass; when turned on in pitch blackness, this produces crisp shadow-outlines of the monkeys on nearby walls.</p> <p>Inside the lantern is a golden flame that can be coaxed bright or darker with a whisper. The bottom of the lantern can be unlatched and opened, revealing some incomprehensible mechanical devices which, with a bit of experimentation, will raise internal shutters up to cover any combination of the glass panes (though, really, those shutters shouldn’t be able to fit in there…). If you close all the shutters and ask the lantern to help you, it will open the shutter that is currently pointing north–letting it function as a compass. The light it sheds can change to any color you request.</p> <p>By manipulating the shutters this can act like a lamp, a flashlight, or anything inbetween. It can illuminate a radius up to 40 yards (as a lamp), or a narrow cone up to 100 yards long (as a flashlight). It can shine in a smaller area by dimming the flame.</p> <p>Finally, if left in a spot and asked to look like a person it can create a vague illusion of a general type of person, large man, small child, thin woman; essentially a body shape and age/gender. The illusion can be seen through with an Awareness check of 10, +1 per yard away from it. This only works in poor lighting (such as at night), and uses up the lantern’s duration 10 times as fast. The illusion can be performing any basic physical task, but nothing elaborate and nothing requiring it to move more than ten feet from the spot the lantern was set down at.</p> <p>Gentou lasts for up to 10 hours before vanishing in a puff of smoke (or up to 1 hour if used as an illusion for the whole duration).</p> <p><strong>Kinnawa - Golden Rope</strong><br> Created from golden monkey hairs braided into a thick rope, the Kinnawa is long enough to be used as an improvised belt when it appears. At the summoner’s command it can extend or shorten again, and despite it’s gaudy tassels on the ends it is very tough.</p> <p>By far the best trick is that it can be thrown up into the air will it will anchor itself to something handy (like the edge of a roof) or absolutely nothing at all, at which point the summoner can climb up it; alternately, it could be thrown across an opening, and the other end anchored as well (on the ground, ideally) to let it be used like a tightrope. The summoner can cause the rope to un-anchor itself simply by willing it to do so while giving it a sharp tug.</p> <p>The rope has a DR of 100, but can only take 10 damage before snapping. The segment closest to the summoner remains, while the rest vanishes in a puff of smoke. The rope can be thrown up to 50 + (the results of an Athletics roll) feet. Golden rope is also great for tying people up, giving a +20 bonus to the Espionage roll (instead of just +10). Golden rope will last for an hour, or eight hours if immediately used to tie somebody up. It can be summoned against one month (4 OOC days) later.</p> <p><strong>Maitatsu Tsue - Dancing Staff</strong><br> A long, gnarled walking stick, sturdy and sizable enough to be used as a bo staff by the summoner. It has the normal properties of a bo staff (from the Equipment chapter), plus a few unique characteristics.</p> <p>If disarmed or discarded, the staff hops back up to a vertical position of its own volitiong and begins to pogo back to the summoner. The staff starts moving 1 IC after it’s been disarmed, and moves 1 yard per IC; when moving like this, it can be ‘picked up’ as a Speed 0 action. Immobilization penalties slow it down normally.</p> <p>If grabbed by anyone else the staff will wait 5 IC before striking them in the face and bouncing free, applying a Stun 4 effect and resuming its trip back to its summoner.</p> <p>Outside of combat, if propped up and told to ‘stay’ it will do just that. The staff will stand straight up, or at any improbable angle, as if held by an invisible force. It’s virtually immovable like this, and can be used in all sorts of creative ways–such as hopping on top of it and posing dramatically.</p> <p>The staff can be summoned for up to four hours, once every two weeks (2 OOC days).</p> <h4 id="-migawarizaru---substitution-monkey-">–( Migawarizaru - Substitution Monkey )–</h4> <p>Migawarizaru is summoned in response to an attack, the monkey taking the hit for the shinobi. Or, rather, one of his many clones does; a puff of smoke engulfs the ‘ninja’ who was just hit, revealing them to be a monkey, before that monkey vanishes in another puff of smoke. Moments later duplicates of the summoner begin appearing across the battlefield, each of them cloned monkeys disguised as the summoner via Henge no Jutsu. One of them is the summoned monkey himself, indistinguishable from the rest. In the ensuing confusion the summoner is free to either escape the battle, or take advantage of the situation to strike.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 32</li> <li>Special: Interrupt</li> <li>Speed: +6</li> <li>Seal Speed: 10</li> </ul> <p>Effects: Migawizaru functions similarly to Kawarimi. You may use it after failing to dodge a technique, so long as partial defense applies. So long as the dodge’s new total Speed (including the +6 from Migawizaru, and its Seal Speed) would allow it to be used as a valid Interrupt, you may pay 10 AP to fully dodge the attack and use this technique. As a reminder, while you could use AP to reduce the final Speed of Dodge + Migawarizaru to 4 (2+6 = 8, to a minimum of half that with AP), the modified Seal Speed, if above 0, cannot be reduced this way.</p> <p>After the substitution is used, the monkey himself appears along with seven more clones on the battlefield, each of them disguised as the summoner and carrying on with some form of obnoxious antics. The summoner may choose to either immediately attempt to enter stealth (with their opponent(s) receiving an immediate Awareness roll against their Stealth roll), or automatically hide among clones as with a normal Bunshin technique.</p> <p>When the clones are targeted, roll 1dX; X is equal to the number of clones remaining, plus 1 for Migawizaru, plus 1 more if the summoner is hidden among them. On a roll of 1, the Migawizaru is hit and they all vanish. If the summoner is hidden among the clones, 1 hits the summoner (and all the clones vanish, along with Migawizaru) and 2 hits Migawizaru.</p> <h4 id="-daisan-enchouzou---three-great-monkey-statues-">–( Daisan Enchouzou - Three Great Monkey Statues )–</h4> <p>Technically a trio of separate summoning techniques, each one calling a separate giant stone monkey statue. The story behind these statues varies depending upon who you ask, but in the case of the actual summoning contract they serve as a conduit for the summoning of the Handsome Monkey Prince (or maybe he’s just too vain to show up until the summoner’s gone through the effort of calling the statues; really, it could be either one).</p> <p>Each of these techniques has a “(30 - X)” in its Chakra cost. X is the number of IC which have passed since the last time you summoned one of the three statues, with a minimum of 0. Thus, if you summoned one at the beginning of the battle, it would be Chakra 30; if you summoned another 50 IC later, it would also be Chakra 30; and if you summoned the last statue 10 IC after that, it would have a Chakra cost of 50. If you attempt to summon them simultaneously to one another (with clones, most likely), then you all suffer from X being 0, causing their chakra costs to be 60.</p> <p>All three statues have 1000 Hit Points and 200 Damage Reduction each, which is bypassed by large thrown weapons.</p> <h6 id="-iwazaru---speak-no-evil-">–( Iwazaru - Speak No Evil )–</h6> <p>The first monkey appears as 10 yard tall statue that looks to be made out of a gleaming metal of some sort. The statue is that of a sitting monkey covering its mouth with its hands.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 30 + (30 - X)</li> <li>Area: 100</li> <li>Speed: 15</li> <li>Seal Speed: 20</li> </ul> <p>Anyone within the area who speaks, or spends AP to control the actions of a summoned creature, loses half their current AP (after any such expenditure) and gains no AP the next time the initiative count reaches a multiple of 20. Taking any action with a Speed above 10 also incurs this effect, unless the shinobi is careful to be quiet, which amounts to taking a -2 immobilization penalty for their action. After suffering the statue’s effects once, a shinobi will be able to figure out what will cause them from then on.</p> <h6 id="-kikazaru---hear-no-evil-">–( Kikazaru - Hear No Evil )–</h6> <p>Another 10 yard tall statue, this monkey seems to be crafted of a solid white marble. It appears sitting atop the previous statue, hands covering its ears.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 30 + (30-X)</li> <li>Area: 100</li> <li>Speed: 15</li> <li>Seal Speed: 20</li> </ul> <p>Effects: When Kikazaru is summoned, everyone present on the battlefield receives a “Curse Counter”, with its value starting at 0. Whenever someone takes an action, their counter is raised by that action’s Speed. Every time the IC reaches a multiple of 10, the statue ‘checks’ to see who has the highest Curse Counter. That individual (or those individuals, if there’s a tie) suffers a -4 immobilization penalty, and has their Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion penalties doubled.</p> <p>The immobilization penalty lasts until a new individual is cursed (and the Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion penalties double each time, if the same person is the victim repeatedly), or the statue is destroyed or unsummoned.</p> <h6 id="-mizaru---see-no-evil-">–( Mizaru - See No Evil )–</h6> <p>The final statue appears atop any previous statues, creating quite the impressive display being 30 yards tall when all three are in play. Also 10 yards tall, the statue appears to be made of a white wood, the monkey’s hands covering its eyes.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 30 + (30-X)</li> <li>Area: 100</li> <li>Speed: 15</li> <li>Seal Speed: 20</li> </ul> <p>Effects: Whenever anyone in Mizaru’s area inflicts a wound on someone else, they suffer a -8 visibility penalty for 10 IC, +10 per level of severity of the wound (20 for a minor, 30 for a major, etc.). This ends prematurely if the statue is destroyed or unsummoned.</p> <p>Multiple afflictions from this statue don’t stack. Longer durations overwrite shorter ones.</p> <h2 id="summons">Summons</h2> <h5 id="partner-monkey">Partner Monkey</h5> <h6 id="1-summoning">1. Summoning</h6> <p>Appearing as a small brown capuchin, the Partner Monkey is a simple creature summoned to provide assistance with small tasks. Being of such small stature and with little to no combat skills, the Partner Monkey is quite skilled at sneaking into tight spots and stealing small objects.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 25</li> <li>Speed: 15</li> <li>Seal Speed: 10</li> </ul> <h6 id="2-behavior">2. Behavior</h6> <p>One of the few monkeys that can’t speak, the Partner Monkey can easily understand most orders, and if treated well it will be happy to follow any that don’t put it into danger. Not helping out of the goodness of it’s own heart… the Partner Monkey likes to be given treats. Fruits and candies are usually enough to get it to perform most any task that it doesn’t think is immediately dangerous.</p> <h6 id="3-attributes">3.

They do not normally accumulate penalties to Stamina or Chakra Exhaustion; if they have penalties from an outside source (such as Suffocation or some poisons), add those to the effective Stamina or Chakra cost to determine how much Vitality they lose.</p> <p><strong>Dextrous Fingers</strong><br> A Partner Monkey has small hands with powerful fingers, allowing it to pick locks without the use of any lockpicks.</p> <p><strong>Extraordinary Reflexes</strong><br> Given the monkey’s agility, it can dodge attacks as a Speed 0 interrupt.</p> <p><strong>Might of the Meek</strong><br> Though small and wary of any sort of direct combat, Partner Monkey’s live up to their name of being capable allies to those that seek them out and are in fact highly capable of aiding their summoners, provided they know to convince them sufficiently to do so (aka, bribe them). Whenever you summon a Partner Monkey, subtract the minimum XP required to summon it (1600 XP) from your Earned XP: that is the X value to determine what bonuses, if any, it gets from the following modifiers. X has a maximum of 3400.</p> <ul> <li>( X/50 ) * 10 to Vitality</li> <li>( X/200 ) to Accuracy, Defensive rolls, Skill rolls, and Genjutsu rolls</li> <li>( X/50 ) * 0.1 to Damage Bonuses</li> <li>( X/200 ) * 0.1 to Movement Speed</li> </ul> <p>In all cases, you round down. The bonus to skill rolls only applies to skills the summon has listed.</p> <p><strong>Small</strong><br> The Partner Monkey is very small and light, and can utilize the Hide action without needing to meet its normal requirements. When they do Hide, they begin at Stealth level 2, and can move in Stealth level 2 without lowering the level of their Stealth, however none of their attacks are ever considered Surprise Attacks (even if made from hiding), as they just aren’t very threatening. If hit by an area of effect technique, the Partner Monkey takes only half damage and suffers a knockback equal to the Area of the attack; knockback effects otherwise have their severity doubled.</p> <h6 id="4-abilities">4. Abilities</h6> <p><strong>Standard Actions</strong><br> Partner Monkey may use Dodge, Hide, Move, and Search as described in the Combat chapter of the PHB, without their summoner needing to spend AP. In addition, they can use Escape Grapple (E-rank Grapple jutsu) without having to pay any cost for its use.</p> <p><strong>Bite</strong> <em>(Speed 8, 4 AP)</em><br> Not an amazing combatant, the Partner Monkey usually gets out of dangerous situations using it’s teeth. A bite inflicts 4d10 piercing damage and is considered a basic unarmed attack. The Partner Monkey’s bite is far more painful than it is actually damaging and if it hits someone who is grappling it, it automatically gets a roll to escape the grapple, with a +10 to its roll.</p> <p><strong>Scout</strong> <em>(Speed Variable, 10 AP)</em><br> One of the few uses of the Partner Monkey in a combat situation, the Summoner can send the Partner Monkey out to scout an area. This works by giving the monkey a general location to scout out and choosing how long they wish the monkey to be gone. The Partner Monkey can move 3 yards per IC towards the location. Once there the monkey does a quick search (using up 0 IC), but can also use 6 more IC to do a Search action.</p> <p>When declaring a scouting action you may choose to set a time for the monkey to return in which case it will only have scouted the area it was able to reach before have to come back… or you may have the Partner Monkey simply go to an area and search a few times (your choice of how many) before coming back. Note that the speed of the action is based upon how far the Partner Monkey has to travel (and travel back from) as well as time spent searching. Upon it’s return, the Monkey will perform a sort of pantomime that for some reason the Summoner is able to understand and gain general details about the scouted area. These details include: general terrain, prescence of enemies (that it saw using awareness), and any obstacles.</p> <p><strong>Monkey Mission</strong> <em>(Speed Variable, 5 AP per action/skill use)</em><br> Similar to the Scout action, the summoner sends the Monkey on a non-dangerous mission utilizing it’s skills. This could be as simple as hopping over a fence and undoing a latch from the other side to as complicated as scaling a building, unlocking a window, opening a safe, and finally stealing a set of plans before coming back. Like scouting, the Partner Monkey’s travel time is determined by how fast it can move and how far it’s told to go and requires 10 IC for each use of a skill other than awareness. The Monkey can be sent on a wide range of missions, but be warned that if it senses any danger it can’t be sure to avoid it will abandon the mission and return rather than braving the odds.</p> <p><strong>Perform Ninjutsu</strong> <em>(Speed Variable, Variable AP)</em><br> The Partner Monkey can actually perform a small selection of Ninjutsu, or be commanded to perform them at a set time. The Partner Monkey has a Seal Speed reduction of 6, and does not use Stamina or Chakra rolls when using the Jutsu it knows. Instead, subtract (Chakra Cost)*3 from the Partner Monkey’s Vitality whenever it uses a Jutsu. The Summoner has to spend AP equal to 1/2 the speed of the jutsu(including the remaining seal speed).</p> <p><strong>Jutsu Known</strong></p> <ul> <li>Ninjutsu: Henge no Jutsu - Limited to a small wind up monkey toy with cymbals.</li> <li>Ninjutsu: Genjutsu Kai - Can use on the summoner, but only if commanded to.</li> <li>Fuuton: Soujikaze no Jutsu - Clearing out smoke and mist.</li> <li>Fuuton: Kazekiri - Cutting ropes or making openings in thin barriers.</li> <li>Fuuton: Rakuyou Buyou - Escaping once it sees danger.</li> <li>Fuuton: Nagare - To leap down from extreme heights.</li> </ul> <h6 id="5-terms-of-contract">5. Terms of Contract</h6> <p>The partner monkey has been known to refuse a mission if it does not receive a treat or trinket as payment when summoned or given particular taxing tasks (most ninja capable of summoning it will keep a bag of peanuts or a few shiny beads around, for just this purpose). If the summoner knowingly sends the monkey into danger (deliberate combat, or as a decoy), the partner monkey will immediately leave, and this will be considered a Breach of Contract. Even afterwards, the monkey will be grumpy when summoned, and require heavy condolences (bananas work wonders) before listening to the summoner at all.</p> <p>Being summoned to help the summoner when they’re in genuine, dire need (meaning the summoner is already fighting, and doesn’t, for example, immediately hide or flee once the monkey shows up) is acceptable, but the monkey does not like it and will only perform up to four actions (be they attacks or jutsu) before it protests and leaves in a puff of smoke. Again, it will require an ‘apology’ in the form of gifts before helping again.</p> <h5 id="monkey-prince">Monkey Prince</h5> <h6 id="1-summoning-1">1. Summoning</h6> <p>The Handsome Monkey Prince (or, “Tansei Sarukou”) has an almost human stature, bipedal and close to six feet tall, resembling a man with the fur and tail of a monkey. He’s also possessed of incredibly good looks, disarming charm, and phenomenal wit… or, so he tells it. He appears dressed in a bright red breasplate, bracers, and greaves, along with fine black pants and a gaudy golden belt.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 120</li> <li>Speed: 30</li> <li>Seal Speed: 15</li> </ul> <p>The best way to summon the Prince is to first provide a fitting demonstration of one’s admiration for him by summoning the Three Great Monkey Statues. If one is present on the battlefield, his Chakra cost is reduced to 100; if two are present, it’s reduced to 80. If all three statues are present in battle, it only costs 40 Chakra to summon the prince.</p> <p>When he’s summoned, the statues vanish. The statues themselves cannot be summoned while he’s present on a battlefield.</p> <h6 id="2-behavior-1">2. Behavior</h6> <p>Most believe the Monkey Prince added the ‘handsome’ to his own name, a testament to his own pride and vanity. When summoned, he will ‘politely’ ask the summoner to stand back and watch him handle the problem at hand. The more of the statues that were summoned before he was, the more politel he’ll be. With all three having been used to summon him he’ll show up ready and enthusiastic to jump into a fight, so long as the summoner doesn’t try to boss him around. Without any having been used the Monkey Prince will be positively snobbish, and will only fight on the summoner’s behalf if said summoner shows him great respect.</p> <p>In combat, the Monkey Prince actively mocks and humiliates his opponents, dancing around and delivering alternating attacks and taunts. He expects his summoner to stand back and simply watch as the Prince does his thing, unless the Prince is being attacked by a summoner and a summoned creature simultaneously–in which case he expects the summoner to assist him.</p> <h6 id="3-attributes-1">3. Attributes</h6> <p>Vitality: 2200<br> STR: 100<br> RES: 100<br> CHA: 100<br> DEX: 120<br> AGI: 120</p> <p>Accuracy: 35<br> Dodge: +30<br> Damage Bonus: 6.0<br> Genjutsu: +30<br> Movement Speed: 4 per IC</p> <p>Athletics: +30<br> Awareness: +25<br> Espionage: +20<br> Resistance: +15<br> Stealth: +25</p> <p><strong>Extraordinary Reflexes</strong><br> Given the Monkey Prince’s agility, he can dodge attacks as a Speed 0 interrupt.</p> <p><strong>Golden Flip</strong><br> The Monkey Prince suffers no penalty to dodge area of effect techniques, and upon succesfully dodging one can move to any edge of the area automatically.</p> <p><strong>Tireless</strong><br> The Monkey Prince does not need to make Stamina or Chakra Exhaustion rolls when he acts (other than performing jutsu). If forced to by an outside force (such as Suffocation), they have +10 to their rolls.</p> <p><strong>Independent</strong><br> The Monkey Prince is too vain to be given orders by the Summoner. Instead the Monkey Prince will simply attack anyone immediately hostile to his loyal subject (the summoner). In addition, the Monkey Prince acts of his own volition, not requiring AP from the summoner.</p> <p><strong>Mountain-Conquering Pride</strong><br> If pitted against another summoned creature, the Handsome Monkey Prince receives a bonus to his Accuracy, Dodge, Genjutsu, and skill rolls equal to (the minimum listed XP needed to summon that creature)/500, and an increase to his damage bonus equal to (that amount of XP)/1000, to one decimal place as usual. If its XP level is 4000 or higher, he does not pay any cost when using his ninjutsu against them.</p> <p>If fighting a person, these bonuses instead come from that individual’s actual XP (sub-total XP, in the case of clanless). If fighting both people and summons (or multiple of either), he only uses the highest bonus.</p> <p><strong>Peerless Champion</strong><br> The monkey prince uses only a fraction of his real strength in order to give his opponents a sporting chance, and if someone exceeds his expectations will raise them accordingly. Every time one of his attacks misses, he gains +2 Accuracy for the rest of the battle. Every time he fails to dodge an attack, he gains +1 dodge for the rest of the battle. Every time he has a Genjutsu used against him (successful or not), he gains +2 to his Genjutsu defense.</p> <p>Finally, every time the damage from one of his attacks is completely prevented (such as by DR, or the Earth Shore Return technique) his physical and ninjutsu damage bonuses are both increased by 2 for the remainder of the battle.</p> <h6 id="4-abilities-1">4. Abilities</h6> <p><strong>Standard Actions</strong><br> The Monkey Prince may use Dodge, Parry, Move, and Block as described in the Combat chapter of the PHB.</p> <p><strong>Strike</strong> <em>(Speed 8)</em><br> Skilled with using his hands, feet, tail, and most other parts of his body as a weapon the Monkey Prince can strike pretty hard when he wants to. While he could hit much harder than he does–he’s strong enough to lift mountains overhead, he’ll assure his summoners–he prefers to goad his opponents with weaker, glancing blows. A strike from the Prince does 10d10 Blunt damage, as a basic unarmed attack.</p> <p><strong>Golden Cloud</strong> <em>(Speed 4)</em><br> The Monkey Prince is well known for his flying Golden Cloud, and for the listed speed he can summon it to his side and hop on. It is, as its name suggests, a small opaque golden cloud, about four feet across. The Prince can sit or stand on it; anyone else simply falls through. On the cloud the Monkey Prince has a +3 bonus to dodge and can move 5 yards every IC. If he makes an attack or uses a jutsu he dismounts from the cloud, and has to call it again to receive its benefits. Despite its ability to fly, the cloud can only reach an altitude of 30 yards. The Prince claims this is an arbitrary limit he has imposed upon it in combat, to make fights more fair for his opponents.</p> <p><strong>Decoy</strong> <em>(Speed 5, Interrupt)</em><br> When attempting to dodge against a melee-range attack and gaining only a partial success, the Monkey Prince can spend 50 Vitality to avoid the attack entirely and leave a clone behind. The prince immediately makes a Stealth roll with a +15 bonus, opposed by his opponent’s Awareness. On success, the Prince is hidden and the opponent thinks the clone is the prince.</p> <p>The clone will call the opponent names, taunt them, and dodge attacks until it’s hit–at which point it’s destroyed, as with a normal clone, and the enemy will realize what happened. However, the Prince will still be hidden!</p> <p><strong>Perform Ninjutsu</strong> <em>(Speed Variable)</em><br> The Monkey Prince knows ninjutsu! It’s mostly something he learned because it was interesting, but he got bored and stopped learning jutsu after picking a few Katon and Fuuton techniques. He could learn all the ninjutsu if he pleased, but it would be much too troublesome.</p> <p>He reduces Seal Speeds by 12, and does not make Stamina or Chakra rolls when using jutsu. Instead, his current Vitality is reduced by (Chakra cost)*3 whenever he performs a jutsu. The Prince knows the following techniques:</p> <p><strong>Jutsu Known</strong></p> <ul> <li>Fuuton: Wind Release Stream</li> <li>Fuuton: Great Breakthrough (generally used to knock people away before they get close, for harassment purposes)</li> <li>Fuuton: Violent Wind Palm (he doesn’t carry any throwing weapons)</li> <li>Fuuton: Wind Turtle’s Shell</li> <li>Fuuton: Vaulting Leap</li> <li>Katon: Flame Flower</li> <li>Katon: Sticky Fire Technique</li> <li>Katon: Grand Fireball</li> <li>Katon: Great Dragon Fire</li> </ul> <h6 id="5-terms-of-contract-1">5. Terms of Contract</h6> <p>The Handsome Monkey Prince is extremely vain and self important. If the summoner doesn’t show him proper respect and deferential treatment (flattery always helps), the Prince will get annoyed and leave. There are many nobles who absolutely abhor sycophants, but the Handsome Monkey Prince is not one of them. The more the summoner praises and fawns over him, the more the Prince will like the summoner and enjoy being called out to assist them.</p> <p>In combat, once the Monkey Prince is summoned he will expect the summoner to stand aside and let the Prince fight. If the summoner tries to help the Monkey Prince will tell him to stop, and step aside; if the summoner continues, the Prince will get angry and leave.</p> <p>That being said, if his enemy goes out of their way to attack the summoner, the Prince won’t object to them defending themselves or retaliating. Similarly, if he’s fighting a summoner and their own summoned creature, he won’t mind his own summoner helping him. However, in other situations he’ll want to fight alone (or possibly with the help of other summoned monkeys), even if outnumbered.</p> <h5 id="pillar-monkey">Pillar Monkey</h5> <h6 id="1-summoning-2">1. Summoning</h6> <p>Guardians against evil, Munamochisaru (“Pillar-Supporting Monkeys”) are strong enough to act as pillars and hold the roofs of massive shrines up. They’re enormous, more than forty feet tall and rippling with muscles; despite being often mistaken for apes, they are, in fact, giant monkeys. These enormous, brown-furred creatures are far more serious than most of their kin, some of the most dutiful and honor-bound of their species, and prove quick to defend their summoners. That said, they’re not much use for anything that doesn’t involve brute force. Being a forty foot tall monkey sort of… has that effect.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 40</li> <li>Speed: 25</li> <li>Seal Speed: 25</li> </ul> <h6 id="2-behavior-2">2. Behavior</h6> <p>Supposedly, the Munamochi-saru can speak and perform handseals like other monkeys can–however, none of them ever seem to do so. They understand orders, and seem to be quite intelligent, but say nothing in response, usually just gruffly nodding their heads, occasionally grunting in affirmation, and solving problems with their muscles.</p> <p>They’re quick to use their size and strength to defend the summoner and any of the summoner’s friends or allies. They’ll also actively defend the pure and innocent, even without orders (this almost always includes children; adults are another matter entirely). They usually have no qualms about attacking the summoner’s enemies, but will try to minimalize collateral damage, as they’re very capable of tearing up massive areas of the landscape when they fight.</p> <h6 id="3-attributes-2">3. Attributes</h6> <p>Vitality: 4500<br> STR: 180<br> RES: 140<br> CHA: 100<br> DEX: 120<br> AGI: 120</p> <p>Accuracy: 46<br> Damage Bonus: 10.0<br> Genjutsu Defense: +25<br> Movement Speed: 2.5 per IC</p> <p>Athletics: +30<br> Awareness: +35<br> Espionage: +15<br> Resistance: +25<br> Stealth: +10</p> <p><strong>Extended Range</strong><br> Munamochi-Saru have a 10 yard attack range, which is still melee due to their large size.</p> <p><strong>Huge</strong><br> Munamochi-Saru cannot dodge; against Area of Effect attacks, they block them automatically as a Speed 0 defense. They can not enter any level of Stealth, nor Hide. They are too heavy to be knocked airborne, knocked back, or knocked prone, and ignore any jutsu or effects that work by binding or physically restraining them. Damage from all Small weapons (including Multi-throws) deals half its normal damage, calculated before any potential Partial Success.</p> <p>Their physical damage bonus is doubled against anyone who is not Huge or Titanic in size, and they do not take penalties for being in a grapple with anyone who is not Huge or Titanic in size; anyone who is not at least Large (meaning all humans except those with the Large unique, or Akimichi in Baika X = 6+) cannot grapple them due to their size, and gaining control of a grapple the creature initiated merely has the grapple end, rather than allowing them to take control of it.</p> <p>Attempting to parry an attack from this creature requires a Strength of 125 or more, or an unarmed physical damage bonus of 12.5 or greater.</p> <p><strong>Tireless</strong><br> Munamochi-Saru do not need to make Stamina or Chakra Exhaustion rolls when they act. If forced to by an outside force (such as Suffocation), they have +25 to their rolls.</p> <h6 id="4-abilities-2">4. Abilities</h6> <p><strong>Standard Actions</strong><br> Munamochi-Saru may use Move as described in the Combat chapter of the PHB, without their summoner needing to spend AP. They may use Take The Hit normally, but commanding them to do so costs 4 AP.</p> <p><strong>Monkey Smash</strong> <em>(Speed 10, 4 AP)</em><br> The giant monkey punches, claws, or kicks those that it’s set against. This deals 14d20 Blunt or Slashing damage, and is considered a basic unarmed attack.</p> <p><strong>Ground Pound</strong> <em>(Speed 20, 8 AP)</em><br> Balling up both fists, Munamochi-saru slams both hands into the ground or upon a downed opponent in a hammering motion. Chakra is poured into the ground and it shatters, opening up around the monkey before it hops back out of the area. This strikes an area of 40 yards with a penalty of -2 to accuracy. It deals 28d20 damage and is considered Unarmed Taijutsu. If used on a prone target, Ground Pound’s damage is considered 150% higher for inflicting wounds.</p> <p><strong>Tail Sweep</strong> <em>(Speed 6, 5 AP)</em><br> As Munamochi-saru are such a huge and imposing monkeys, most think of them as apes. However, they are in fact still monkeys, and as such have tails. A tail sweep usually involves the monkey feinting forwards ominously with one arm, then whipping their tail out to sweep an opponent off their feet. This attack only does 9d12 damage; if it hits, the victim next gets an Awareness roll against the monkey’s Accuracy. If they pass, they suffer a Stun 2. If they fail, they’re left prone as per the E-rank Trip taijutus.</p> <p>Tail Sweep always rolls Accuracy, using 1d20 + 36. If it knocks someone prone, the Munamochi-saru can pay 5 AP and immediately follow up with a Ground Pound (at its normal AP cost, and adding its normal Speed to when the monkey will act next) at that target, using its Tail Sweep accuracy with a -2 penalty in place of Ground Pound’s normal accuracy.</p> <p><strong>Monkey Pillar</strong> <em>(Speed 3 + X, Interrupt, X AP, Chakra 10 + 2 * X)</em><br> In addition to acting as living pillars, the Munamochi-saru are quite capable of creating them. Driving their hands into the ground (be it loose earth or solid stone), they can lift a solid wall or pillar in front of them. Even if used on dirt or sand, the pillar will be hardened into solid stone when it’s raised this way.</p> <p>This is used as a defensive Interrupt, automatically succeeding and blocking up to X*100 damage. Any damage over this amount carries through to the Munamochi-saru. This is treated as a Doton ninjutsu, and takes double damage from Raiton, but only half from Sution. Anyone within five yards of the monkey will also be protected by this wall. It can only be used against attacks originating 10 yards or more away from the Munamochi-saru.</p> <h6 id="5-terms-of-contract-2">5. Terms of Contract</h6> <p>The pillar-supporting monkeys are not dim-witted, but are still fairly simple creatures. As long as the summoner doesn’t ask them to do more than use their brute strength and size, they’ll get along just fine.</p> <p>The one thing they will never do is harm pure-hearted innocents, and attempting to convince one to do so knowingly is a Breach of Contract.</p> <h5 id="enma">Enma</h5> <h6 id="1-summoning-3">1. Summoning</h6> <p>Enma is an eight foot tall, white-furred monkey with a body structure similar to a human, allowing him to walk upright and swing from limbs like an ape. He wears a black suit with mesh armor underneath, and to top it off a sleeveless kimono made of tiger fur with white trim and held closed with a sash. He usually has a very grumpy look on his face.</p> <ul> <li>Chakra: 65</li> <li>Speed: 30</li> <li>Seal Speed: 35</li> </ul> <h6 id="2-behavior-3">2. Behavior</h6> <p>Monkeys are somewhat fickle and it can be quite a complicated process to gain their trust. That said, once the Monkey King has grown fond of someone (a long process) he will treat them as a member of his monkey troop and fight fiercely to protect them. That said, Monkeys have plenty of better things to be doing with their time and Enma doesn’t like being summoned for frivolous purposes.</p> <p>Having grown quite old and cantankerous, Enma will only answer a summons if the summoner’s life is on the line. Where that line is drawn is dependent on how well he knows the summoner in question. He also has a long-standing unfriendly rivalry with the Spider Queen Tsuchigumo, and will answer any summons to fight her.</p> <p>Enma does not generally take orders. He’ll do what the summoner needs, but will usually decide for himself how he wants to go about accopmlishing their goal. The better the summoner’s rapport with Enma, the more closely he’ll cooperate with them. If Enma has faith in his summoner’s abilities, he may even use his ability to transform into the legendary Adamantine Staff, a weapon said to be indestructible and possessed of numerous supernatural capabilities, for his summoner to wield.</p> <p>In addition, Enma is well-schooled in the ninja arts and has an extensive suite of ninjutsu he can perform. He actually outclasses many ninja with his jutsu use. While other Avatars are immense beasts capable of causing destruction on a massive scale, the Monkey King Enma is smarter, more skilled, and able to become an undefeatable weapon in the right hands.</p> </d-article> <d-appendix> <d-footnote-list></d-footnote-list> <d-citation-list></d-citation-list> </d-appendix> <d-bibliography src="/assets/bibliography/"></d-bibliography> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 Anchorsify .
