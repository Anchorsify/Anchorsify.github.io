Konoha experiences the full gamut of desirable weather - that is to say, it’s usually sunny, and even the rainy days can be pleasant. The village is roughly one third smaller than it was before the war, but strolling down the streets of Konoha you might never realize unless someone told you.</p> <p>Konoha does not appear to have been damaged by the war at all. The unwavering Will of Fire blazed in the hearts of the survivors and they set about rebuilding and landscaping the damaged parts of the village almost immediately. Narrow brick pathways sprawl from the outer edges of the village, shaded by decades old oak trees, leading to small housing communities tucked neatly into the forest. The village is more a part of the forest now than it had ever been in the past. Many buildings in downtown Konoha received new facades or were rebuilt completely. Beyond this, the village isn’t looking to waste resources on overextending its boundaries. They make room for new citizens as it’s required. In the meantime, all the spaces reserved for future expansion are filled with neatly kept parks and forested areas.</p> <p>The forces of Konoha have the clans of Aburame, Akimichi, Inuzuka, Hyuuga, Nara, Senju, Uchiha, and the Yamanaka to call upon.</p> <p>After the Fourth Great Shinobi war, Konoha was no longer the most densely populated village. They had the largest population of civilians and shinobi before the war - and in honor of all those lost they built a second monument in the east. As tradition in Konoha goes, they’ll never forget those who gave their lives for their village, but they won’t let the past keep them from building the brightest future they can. Even a century after the war, the Will of Fire burns more brightly now than it had ever in the past.</p> <p>Unfortunately all of this good will does not pay the bills. Because Konoha had the most to lose, it lost the most. They’re steadily rebuilding, and each generation of shinobi seems more bright and promising than the last.</p> <h2 id="aburame">Aburame</h2> <p>The Aburame are one of four noble clans of Konohagakure, a quiet clan whose members usually keep to themselves. They are fairly distinct in the way they dress themselves, usually covering the majority of their body with their clothing, with dark glasses that hide their eyes. They are soft-spoken, often preferring only to speak when they have something worthwhile to say.</p> <p>Their solitude may have to do with their clan’s techniques, as every clan member at a young age becomes host to a hive of insects called Kikaichuu, a special type of beetle-like bug which can actually eat the chakra of their enemies in battle. Their bodies become the nest of the bugs, and over time they form a symbiotic relationship that allows the Aburame to mentally control and direct them. While a powerful kekkai genkai, it is not an ability that interests most people.</p> <p><strong>Aburame begin with 1 less Unique Point.</strong></p> <hr> <p><strong>–( Kikaichuu no Jutsu – Parasitic Destruction Insect Technique )—</strong> <br>An ability exclusive to the Aburame, wherein they allow their own bodies to become a hive for the Kikaichuu.</p> <ul> <li>Type: Ability</li> <li>Base Cost: 2</li> <li>Scale: 0</li> <li>Limit: 3+CHA/10</li> </ul> <p>Effects: You gain a Swarm the first time this is taken, and add one to it for every rank after the first. As part of the cost of being a host of the Kikaichuu, you gain RES<em>2 less to your Vitality, and RES less to your Hit Points (making them RES</em>6+STR<em>4 and RES</em>2+CHA, respectively, before any Uniques).</p> <p>Kikaichuu can be commanded out to a maximum range of CHA*2 yards. Any further than that and you can no longer communicate with them and can only send them to places you know, and can only give them a single, basic command (“Go home and find Ino” would work, but “Search the town for anything suspicious” would not). They will complete it to the best of their ability and then return to you, but for every day in which they are beyond the listed range, its Swarm Size is reduced by one.</p> <p>Every Swarm deployed must have one Female Kikai with it (see below for acquiring Female Kikai), and the Female Kikai is only considered killed when the entire Swarm is destroyed. For every additional Female Kikai you have in a swarm past the first, that Swarm gains +1 to its Accuracy and any d20 rolls it makes, but extra Female Kikai are destroyed earlier, requiring at least two Swarm Size per Female Kikai. If you had 3 Female Kikai in a Size 5 swarm, the third would be destroyed if it was reduced to Size 4, and the second would be destroyed if it was reduced to Size 2.</p> <p>For every one Swarm Size, the Swarm has effectively CHA in Vitality. They do not actually lose Vitality though, instead they lose 1 Swarm Size for every (CHA) in damage they take from an attack. There’s no limit to this, but you always round down. If Shino had a Swarm Size 5 and 60 CHA, and someone did 298 damage to the Swarm, the Swarm would be reduced to Size 1, and any future attacks would require doing 60 damage to destroy the remaining Swarm Size, not 2.</p> </d-article> <d-appendix> <d-footnote-list></d-footnote-list> <d-citation-list></d-citation-list> </d-appendix> <d-bibliography src="/assets/bibliography/"></d-bibliography> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 Anchorsify .
