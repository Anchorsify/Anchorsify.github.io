But, yeah, it’s pretty distracting. This inflicts a Stun 4 (extending), +4 per time taken in the same battle, with a -1 to Genjutsu rolls until the Stun ends.</p> <h6 id="11---25-bruised-arm">(11 - 25) Bruised (Arm)</h6> <p>Your arm is bruised. It hurts, inflicting a Stun 6 (extending), +2 per time taken in the same battle, with -1 Acc and +2 to Seal Speeds until the Stun ends.</p> <h6 id="26---55-bruised-ribs-torso">(26 - 55) Bruised Ribs (Torso)</h6> <p>As in the bones, not the skin over them. Truth is, ribs hurt a lot more than they have any business doing. Breathing hurts in particular, deep breathing especially so. This inflicts a Stun 8 (extending), +2 per time taken in the same battle, with a Shock 1 status effect which doesn’t end until the Stun does.</p> <h6 id="56---80-winded-abdomen">(56 - 80) Winded (Abdomen)</h6> <p>A good shot to the gut hit your solar plexus or compressed your diaphragm, or both, knocking the wind out of you. You’ll be fine, definitely, but this inflicts a Stun 8 (extending), +2 per time taken in the same battle, along with Immobilize 1 which doesn’t end until the Stun does.</p> <h6 id="81---100-bruised-leg">(81 - 100) Bruised (Leg)</h6> <p>Something hit your leg and now it hurts! You’ll feel better after you walk it off (or just sit down and let the pain fade). This inflicts a Stun 10 (extending), +2 per time taken in the same battle, with a -1 to Dodges and -10% movespeed until the Stun ends.</p> <h2 id="blunt-major">Blunt (Major)</h2> <h6 id="1---10-dazed-head">(1 - 10) Dazed (Head)</h6> <p>That one left you reeling. Once you’re done seeing stars, you’ll be… mostly okay. You are automatically knocked Prone, and you suffer the effects of Ringing Noise (Blunt Minor head wound) on top of it, which counts for its cumulative Stun increase. You also drop all Upkeeps whose unmodified cost is (Stun/2) or less (though you can reactivate them once the Stun ends), and you take a -2 to Genjutsu and all Skill rolls until this wound heals. Everything seems just a little bit… off, about the world, though you can’t quite place what. Sounds are muffled, colors muted, and things keep moving at the edge of your vision. This wound lasts for four weeks.</p> <h6 id="11---25-sprained-arm-arm">(11 - 25) Sprained Arm (Arm)</h6> <p>Your elbow or wrist was forced to bend in a way it’s not meant to by the blow, and sprained in the process. Firstly, you drop anything you’re holding in the arm affected. Secondly, you take a -1 to Accuracy and your PDB, -2 to Grapple rolls, and you increase all Seal Speeds by 2. It takes two weeks to recover from, though weeks in which you use the arm don’t count towards its recovery.</p> <h6 id="26---55-collapsed-lung-torso">(26 - 55) Collapsed Lung (Torso)</h6> <p>Whatever hit you managed to knock you across the battlefield and made your lung quit its day job; unfortunately, that day job was letting you breathe. You’re knocked back 8 yards (or increase the attack’s existing knockback by 8), and your Fatigue rolls have a -4 penalty; you can live with both lungs collapsed, though that raises the penalty to -12 (rather than just -8), though taking this wound more than twice doesn’t increase the penalty. It takes only a week of medical treatment to get over this, but it won’t get better without that treatment.</p> <h6 id="56---80-groin-shot-abdomen">(56 - 80) Groin Shot (Abdomen)</h6> <p>If this was a called shot, you should probably having a serious talk with your opponent about what constitutes fair fighting. It automatically knocks you prone, and inflicts a Stun 16 (extending), and until it’s healed, you take a -4 to all status rolls (whether inflicting or resisting). It takes two weeks to recover from.</p> <h6 id="81---100-sprained-leg-leg">(81 - 100) Sprained Leg (Leg)</h6> <p>The muscles and ligaments in your knee or ankle were stretched beyond their capacity. You’re automatically knocked prone upon first taking the wound, and take -1 to Dodges and -10% movespeed, which is doubled for 10 IC after you move (as an action) or dodge. It takes four weeks to heal.</p> <h2 id="blunt-severe">Blunt (Severe)</h2> <h6 id="1---10-concussion-head">(1 - 10) Concussion (Head)</h6> <p>Somebody turned out the lights. It is very dark, and you are likely to be eaten by a grue. Thankfully, you get over that before your enemies can capitalize on it (or you’re eaten). You take a -3 to all d20 rolls and reduce all AP gains by 3. Whenever you suffer a Head wound (of any type: Slashing, Piercing, etc.), you have a stacking 10% chance to suffer Ringing Noise (Minor Blunt Head wound) in addition to the other one; the chance resets to 10% each time you suffer it, but doesn’t go away until the wound itself does (along with its other penalties), which takes twelve weeks to recover from without rest, but if you take any other head wound while this one is healing, its recovery time completely resets. Medical treatment does not help this wound heal any faster.</p> <h6 id="11---25-broken-arm-arm">(11 - 25) Broken Arm (Arm)</h6> <p>Someone broke your arm, which has left it more or less unusable at present unless there’s a medic-nin nearby who’s willing to take pity on you. The arm broken can’t be used in grapples (and if both are broken, you can’t initiate a grapple at all), you can’t wield or use two-handed weapons at all, and you take a Stun 6 whenever you parry. The worst part of all, however, is that you can’t benefit from any Upkeeps which increase your PDB or NDB until it heals, as you’re unable to effectively fully reinforce your attacks. Two months of not using the arm will be sufficient for it to heal.</p> <h6 id="26---55-broken-ribs">(26 - 55) Broken Ribs</h6> <p>You are in horrible, terrible pain. You’d be screaming and/or mewling, if you weren’t a ninja! Breathing feels like you’re being stabbed–and depending on how badly broken those ribs are, that might be exactly what’s happening. You can no longer Block, and you take a -2 to Accuracy and d20 rolls, along with increasing the speed of all actions by 2 (though this does not increase their damage). Attacks which reduce blocking’s effectiveness (such as weapon attacks, and Fuuton) additionally force you to make a status roll against the attacker’s Athletics (for Taijutsu) or Chakra Control (for ninjutsu/genjutsu), and if you fail, the penalties from this wound are doubled for 30 IC (becoming -4 Accuracy and d20 rolls and +4 speed to all actions, for example). It takes eight weeks to recover from.</p> <h6 id="56---80-crushed-organ-abdomen">(56 - 80) Crushed Organ (Abdomen)</h6> <p>It’s not as bad as it sounds, honestly. There’s some severe bleeding and bruising inside the organ itself, and it hurts horrendously, but it’s not bleeding out into other parts of your body.. so it could be worse. Unfortunately, it’s still quite painful and completely prevents you from being able to use the Rest action in combat, and applies a -8 to Resistance rolls thanks to the pain from one organ spreading to all the others nearby. Each week the penalty to Resistance is reduced by one, though you can’t Rest until the penalty is 0 (and this wound is then considered healed).</p> <h6 id="81---100-broken-leg-leg">(81 - 100) Broken Leg (Leg)</h6> <p>Severe damage to your leg has left you with a reduced ability to locomote around the battlefield! If worst comes to worst, you can still power-hobble on it; it doesn’t directly penalize your movement, but moving has a Stun 5added to it (even moving as part of an attack), and you can’t use any sort of jutsu to move (like Vaulting Leap) or increase your movement speed (like Lightning Warrior) so long as your leg is broken. Your leg won’t get better if you’re walking around on it. If you walk with crutches (or a cane, or something of the sort) you can move at only half speed, but it allows you move around while recover from this wound, which takes a total of two months. Each time you opt to run around unaided on it extends the remaining recovering time by a week.</p> <h2 id="blunt-critical">Blunt (Critical)</h2> <h6 id="1---10-fractured-skull-head">(1 - 10) Fractured Skull (Head)</h6> <p>You got hit in the head hard enough that you’re lucky you don’t have (much) brain damage. This will usually be accompanied by nasty lacerations and prolific bleeding, but not always. Aside from a Stun 16, you suffer a -4 penalty to Accuracy and all d20 rolls, which is doubled for Genjutsu. This takes 15 weeks to heal. If you suffer a Head Wound (of any type) while you have and are recovery from this wound, roll 1d20: On 1 - 10, you go unconscious and comatose until that wound fully heals (even if it takes longer than it does for your Fractured Skull to finish healing), on a 11 - 20 you suffer another Stun 16. You will be comatose and unconscious for a minimum of 24 hours after triggering this effect, even for a Minor head wound.</p> <h6 id="11---25-shattered-arm-arm">(11 - 25) Shattered Arm (Arm)</h6> <p>You arm is so broken that the breaks have breaks. It’s useless. You can’t perform handseals, hold weapons or use items with it, and so forth. Thanks to the pain, and the fact that all your attacks are basically coming from the same angle with one arm now a non-factor, you take a -5 to Accuracy until you can regain the use of your arm. After four weeks of medical treatment, the pain will be manageable, and the penalties will be reduced to a mere -3 Accuracy (though you still can’t use the arm). Only after that will it begin to actually heal, which takes a total of ten weeks, or twenty without medical treatment.</p> <h6 id="26---55-sternal-fracture-torso">(26 - 55) Sternal Fracture (Torso)</h6> <p>Your sternum is that rather lengthy, thoroughly sturdy piece of bone and cartilage that runs down the middle of your chest that all your ribs connect to. They’re pretty hard to break. Nice job pulling that one off. This in itself isn’t terribly bad, but whatever hit you with enough force to do that off also managed to break several ribs and cause some significant internal damage. It’s pretty easy to tell your chest is just about ruined: there’s a grinding nose of bone on bone whenever you breathe or try to move too much, for one thing; the agonizing pain’s a pretty good hint, too, inflicting a -5 to all Fatigue rolls and reducing your PDB and NDB by 5. It also makes it much more difficult to maintain and regulate your chakra thanks to your body’s general imbalance, increasing the cost of all Upkeeps by 2.</p> <p>Every week the Fatigue penalty reduces by one. Once that penalty clears, your damage bonuses have their penalty reduced by one every two weeks, and once those are both back to normal, the penalty to Upkeeps goes away.</p> <h6 id="56---80-rupture-abdomen">(56 - 80) Rupture (Abdomen)</h6> <p>Your abdomen’s important because it’s full of all sorts of squishy parts that are pretty important for your continued survival. Whatever kind of trauma you just went through ruptured one of those squishy bits, and now it’s bleeding out all over your insides. Yes, blood belongs inside you, but… not actually inside your abdominal cavity. Every time you act, including movement, you lose HP (not Vitality) equal to the Speed of the action, and roll 1d100 against the action’s Speed*2. If you fail, the rupture is aggravated, and you gain a Poison 1 with a duration equal to the Speed of the action you just took. Every time you take this effect in the same battle, the Poison severity increases by 1 (Poison 1 the first time, Poison 2 the second, etc); there is no limit to how high this can go, and can be fatal. You can suffer from multiple different Poison statuses from this effect at once. Attempts to treat this wound with First Aid require at least 20 ranks in Medicine, and requires a medically inclined person to drain the abdomen of blood before figuring out what’s actually bleeding and making it stop. It’s a Speed 25 action to treat it in this manner, which stops any ongoing Poison statuses from this wound and resets the Poison severity for the combat. It takes 15 weeks to recover from this injury, which won’t heal without medical treatment.</p> <h6 id="81---100-shattered-leg-leg">(81 - 100) Shattered Leg (Leg)</h6> <p>There are broken legs, there are severely broken legs, and then there’s your leg. You can’t stand without something to prop you up, but because you’re a tough-as-nails and super resourceful ninja you can still move, though you do so at half speed. You have a -5 penalty to Dodges and Athletics rolls, the former of which is doubled against Area of Effect attacks.</p> <p>Once you’ve had two weeks of medical treatment and been put in a splint, you can walk so long as you carry a crutch, cane, or walking stick (which does occupy a hand), reducing the penalties to -3, though you still move at half speed. You can do so without out, though each time you take any action which requires you to move (including dodging), or are hit, you have a 50% chance of your leg giving out and resetting the recovery time from this injury. Once you’ve received treatment, it takes twenty weeks to heal, though if you try to go without any medical treatment it’ll take thirty.</p> <h2 id="energy-minor">Energy (Minor)</h2> <h6 id="1---10-sun-spots-head">(1 - 10) Sun Spots (Head)</h6> <p>You were a little too slow in closing your eyes when hit, and now vague shapes resembling the oncoming blast seem to float around in front of you, obscuring your vision. It’s annoying, more than anything else. You’re inflicted with a Burn 3, +1 per time taken in the same battle, with a Visibility Penalty equal to the Burn status you take that lasts until the Burn status ends.</p> <h6 id="11---25-burned-arm">(11 - 25) Burned (Arm)</h6> <p>Your arm’s been burned! It hurts. The skin is red and starting to swell a little, and continued movement tends to be more difficult as you instinctively try to limit its mobility. You’re inflicted with a Burn 2, +1 per time taken in the same battle, along with -1 Accuracy which lasts until the Burn ends.</p> <h6 id="26---55-flash-fever-torso">(26 - 55) Flash Fever (Torso)</h6> <p>The center of your body was hit, which is good, since it’s intended to take the brunt of attacks. But whatever hit you also managed to heat you up so much that your body is having trouble regulating your temperature. You feel vaguely sick and tired, but you’ll shake it off soon. You’re inflicted with a Burn 2, +1 per time taken in the same battle, and have a -1 to Fatigue rolls until the Burn ends.</p> <h6 id="56---80-stomach-blister-abdomen">(56 - 80) Stomach Blister (Abdomen)</h6> <p>A pretty nasty blister managed to emerge from whatever hit you, causing plasma to be stuck within a layer of skin that expanded. It’s gross, and fairly uncomfortable. You’re inflicted with a Burn 2, +1 per time taken in the same battle, along with Paralysis 1 which lasts until the Burn ends.</p> <h6 id="81---100-burned-leg">(81 - 100) Burned (Leg)</h6> <p>Your leg’s been burned! Seriously, it does hurt. It’s red and painful when you put your weight on it trying to do things like run. You’re inflicted with a Burn 2, +1 per time taken in the same battle, and have a -1 to Defenses until the Burn ends.</p> <h2 id="energy-major">Energy (Major)</h2> <h6 id="1---10-facial-burn-head">(1 - 10) Facial Burn (Head)</h6> <p>There’s now a nasty burn across your face, the flesh blistered and raw. It’s disorienting, and you can’t get the smell of burnt flesh out of your nostrils, or the taste out of your mouth, which has the effect of nauseating you whenever you try to breathe deeply. As you exert yourself, you smell it more and more and become progressively sicker. Every time you make a Stamina roll you take a -2 to your Chakra Exhaustion rolls, and take a -2 to Stamina rolls every time you make a Chakra Exhaustion roll. This takes a month to heal on your own, or two weeks with medical treatment.</p> <h6 id="11---25-second-degree-burn-arm">(11 - 25) Second Degree Burn (Arm)</h6> <p>The majority of your arm is burned. While not life threatening, the amount of skin that’s been burned is substantial, making it a great deal more painful to use the arm in battle. When you perform handseals or attack, you take twice the base Speed of the action as damage, which bypasses all reductions. This takes 5 weeks to heal on its own, 3 with medical treatment.</p> <h6 id="26---55-scorched-chest-torso">(26 - 55) Scorched Chest (Torso)</h6> <p>The majority of your body has been burned, taking any hair found on your chest, back, and stomach along with it. Due to the large surface area that entails, it isn’t that deep at any point, but since it covers so much area, it makes it very easy for others to aggravate your injury. You take an additional 10% damage when hit, after all normal reductions but before determining if you suffer wounds. One of the worst parts about it is how it tends to make getting additional wounds that much easier. This takes two weeks to heal, only one with medical attention.</p> <h6 id="56---80-scalded-stomach-abdomen">(56 - 80) Scalded Stomach (Abdomen)</h6> <p>Whatever hit you managed to more or less burn away what covered your midriff and had enough power behind it to significantly heat up your internal organs. This is not good, as your organs can be pretty sensitive about that kind of thing. You take a Stun equal to your RES/10, and have your current and maximum Hit Points and Vitality reduced by your RES until this has healed, which takes three weeks with or without medical treatment.</p> <h6 id="81---100-second-degree-burn-leg">(81 - 100) Second Degree Burn (Leg)</h6> <p>One of your legs has been burned down to the dermis, the layer beneath the epidermis, causing multiple small blisters to form at the surface which can be easily aggravated every time you go to defend yourself. Every time you perform a defensive interrupt in response to an attack, you suffer damage equal to three times the final Speed of the defensive interrupt, bypassing all reductions. It takes three weeks to heal on its own, but only one with medical treatment.</p> <h2 id="energy-severe">Energy (Severe)</h2> <h6 id="1---10-blinded-head">(1 - 10) Blinded (Head)</h6> <p>Your kept your eyes open a little too long when something was aimed right at your face. Just like with it being a bad idea to look directly into the sun, it is also a bad plan to stare directly at a superheated jutsu aimed at your head. Your face as a whole was scalded, but your eyes took the worst of it by remaining open too long. You take a -2 Visibility Penalty, which is reduced by 1 every 10 IC. It is not so bad by itself, until the next time you’re hit by a jutsu that inflicts Energy wounds (regardless of whether or not it does, in fact, actually wound you). When that happens, your visibility penalty is increased by 1 per rank of the jutsu (1 for E, 3 for C, etc.), to a maximum of -8. The technique must deal damage to trigger this effect of the wound. It takes a long time for your eyes to not be so sensitive, reducing the penalty you incur when blinded by 1 every two weeks–for a total of a ten weeks recovery time, to not be blinded by A-rank jutsu. With medical attention, the recovery time is halved.</p> <h6 id="11---25-muscle-melting-arms">(11 - 25) Muscle Melting (Arms)</h6> <p>Not quite as literal as the name implies, but no less serious an injury–you’ve been burned so deep that he muscle itself has been affected. Aside from intense pain, it also weakens the muscle as a substantial section of it has become damaged and useless. Your damage bonuses (Physical and Ninjutsu) are lowered by 10%, and you have a -1 penalty to Accuracy. As you continually use the muscles and chakra pathways that flow through the damaged area, the heat builds and spreads to worsen the injury, inflicting even more damage to both muscles and tenketsu. Whenever you deal damage, the Damage Bonus which was used is afterward lowered by 5%, to a minimum of 50% (halving your damage bonus). When either reaches 50%, your Accuracy is lowered by an additional 1 point, to a maximum of -3 (when both PDB and NDB reach 50% reduction). Additional wounds add 10% to each damage bonus and increases the current and maximum Accuracy penalty by 1, but the 50% reduction cap is unchanged.</p> <p>But despite the wound, a ninja’s body is an amazing machine. Every two weeks, you recover 5% of each damage bonus. With medical attention, you recover that every week. Once both of your damage bonuses are back to normal, the Accuracy penalty goes away, and your bonuses stop decreasing when being used.</p> <h6 id="26---55-dark-halo-torso">(26 - 55) Dark Halo (Torso)</h6> <p>The name comes from the fact that you’ve suffered burns of the entire dermis in a solid, unbroken ring around your body. It is not quite as cool as it sounds–burns of such magnitude can actually cut off circulation to the rest of the body. In short, you’re going into shock, as your body can no longer properly regulate its internal systems. When you advance a fatigue level with this wound, you halve your current penalties to Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion rolls, instead of clearing them fully. A second instance of this wound has no effect, but resets its recovery time, which takes twelve weeks on its own, or six with medical treatment.</p> <h6 id="56---80-side-burns-abdomen">(56 - 80) Side Burns (Abdomen)</h6> <p>The sides of your ribcage have been charred and are almost black, hence the name that resembles a much less gruesome looking hairstyle (though, let’s be honest, it’s still pretty bad). Aside from making the definition of your ribcage more obvious, it also makes it harder to breathe. It isn’t so bad here and there, but that quick, almost gasping inhale taken when you try to spur yourself onward makes you pause and lose your breath, slowing you down when you want to be at your quickest. Every time you spend more than your current Willpower in AP on an action (including the surcharge from this wound), you suffer a Suffocate 2 status after resolving the action which triggered it. Additional instances of this wound increase the Suffocate suffered by 1. The suffocate fades like normal over time, but you will continue to accrue the status effect from this Wound until you take fourteen weeks to let it heal, or seven weeks with medical attention.</p> <h6 id="81---100-fused-foot-leg">(81 - 100) Fused Foot (Leg)</h6> <p>The skin of one of your feet (odds right, evens left) has been burned so badly that the toes are more or less a singular section, melted together. The rest of it isn’t much better, but the most pressing issue how it impairs its functions in battle. For starters, you immediately lose any and all non-jutsu movement speed increases you might have (such as from Runner, or EF), and won’t gain any benefit from them until this wound heals. On top of that, all forms of movement speed for you are reduced by 25%. Finally, you take a -3 to all Defenses, which greatly limits your options considering ‘run away’ is likely also out of the picture. If you mange to survive the combat which inflicted this wound, fixing it medically is the next hurdle to try and jump with one leg: It takes fourteen weeks to heal on its own (though you still need a first aid kit, and at least 10 ranks in Medicine to do so successfully), but only five with medical treatment. You really don’t want to have to debride your own wounds.</p> <h2 id="energy-critical">Energy (Critical)</h2> <h6 id="1---10-eye-welded-shut-head">(1 - 10) Eye Welded Shut (Head)</h6> <p>You got hit in the face by a giant fireball of bolt of lightning, which is basically awful for tons of reasons. Aside from the deep-tissue burns across half your face, the heat was enough to melt the surface of one of your eyelids, fusing it shut. Any ranks in the Enhanced Sight are lost until you recover, as are any abilities dependent upon it. That eye is effectively useless, putting you at a -3 visibility penalty, but it gets worse. The movements of your eyes are synchronous by design: when one looks in a direction, the other follows, meaning that your damage eye, which is basically glued by molten flesh to your eyelid, is still trying to move around, aggravating the injury further. Every 10 IC which pass with your good eye open, you suffer a -1 penalty to Accuracy and d20 rolls, with a maximum of -10. However, if you close both your eyes this penalty these penalties are reduced by 1 every 20 IC (though be aware that closing both eyes incurs a -10 visibility penalty), to a minimum of half the highest value it’s reached (if it got up to -7, closing your eyes couldn’t reduced it below -4). As a reminder, closing or opening your eyes is a Speed 0 action, but not an interrupt.</p> <p>This heals naturally, with the penalty to Accuracy, et cetra, being lowered by 1 for every two weeks that go without it being increased. Once it’s been reduced to 0, it takes twelve more weeks to recover. If the Accuracy/etc penalty returns during that time, healing your eye is interrupted (with ‘progress’ retained) until it’s back to 0. At this point you stop suffering this wound’s effects, but have a semi-permanent -2 visibility penalty. Medical treatment halves all the above times. After another five weeks spent hospitalized, the ‘permanent’ -2 visibility penalty will also be removed.</p> <h6 id="11---25-red-right-hand-arms">(11 - 25) Red Right Hand (Arms)</h6> <p>The name is something of a misnomer, actually–your hand is black. You can’t feel it, you can’t use it. It’s still there, although it’s hard to tell how much of it is salvageable at a glance, because it’s just that badly charred. You lose the usage of a hand. You can not make seals, hold two-handed weapons and so forth. You take a -5 to Accuracy rolls, in addition to being one-handed for the foreseeable future.</p> <p>Recovering from this is about as painful and drawn-out as you’d expect from losing most of your hand. It takes thirty weeks on its own, fifteen weeks with medical attention.</p> <h6 id="26---55-atrial-fibrillation-torso">(26 - 55) Atrial Fibrillation (Torso)</h6> <p>The burns to your chest are so deep and severe that they’re affecting your cardiovascular system. Specifically, the heart, and the rhythm at which it beats. Thankfully, this is the less lethal form of fibrillation, as it means your heart is still able to beat properly and pump blood throughout the body, it just does so irregularly. But it’s still pretty bad, as things like fighting cause your pulse to shoot way up, which increases the workload of your heart and makes it more likely and devastating every time your heart skips a beat. Every 15 IC, you take a -1 to Accuracy and d20 rolls. This penalty can be reduced by half by taking a Rest action (which also resets the 10 IC timer for when it advances), but it can never be reduced below half of the highest penalty you acquired from it (if it reached -7, Resting would reduce it to -4, but then a second Rest action immediately after would not lower it further). When you take the Rest action, you must choose between lowering your Stamina penalty or reducing the penalty from this Wound: you can not do both at the same time.</p> <p>This penalty does not increase outside of combat, but will continue to affect you every time you fight. One of the worst problems with this injury is how it is a chronic condition that the body can’t fix by itself, once it’s happened. You must receive medical attention to get it fixed, and with it, takes six weeks to no longer suffer penalties to d20 rolls. With another six weeks, you don’t take penalties to fatigue, and then with another six you don’t take penalties to Accuracy, and any penalty you still had is removed.</p> <h6 id="56---80-slow-roasted-abdomen">(56 - 80) Slow Roasted (Abdomen)</h6> <p>When something is cooked poorly, the outside tends to burn first, but the inside is typically not that bad. But when something is really charred, it is not just that the outside blackens and dies, but it ends up encapsulating the interior, preventing the escape of heat. That’s basically just what happened to you. So while your skin is flaking from your stomach and looks absolutely horrifying every time you breathe in and out, the real problem is how your insides have been superheated and are unable to effectively cool off. The end result is a constant fever and feeling of sickness that is impossible to ignore. Firstly, you automatically advance one Fatigue level. Secondly, you take -1 to Fatigue rolls every 10 IC which pass: track this penalty separately from all other Fatigue penalties, as this one is not cleared when you advance a Fatigue level. The Rest action becomes Speed 10, for you, and reduces the current penalty you suffer from this wound by half, not below half of the highest penalty reached in the current battle. Resting no longer reduces Stamina penalties as is normal, nor does it do anything but reduce the penalty from this Wound (such as granting AP).</p> <p>Out of combat you recover Fatigue levels at the rate of 1 per OOC day (rather than hour), and cannot recover below Fatigue 1. Similarly, you regain one point of Willpower each OOC day, rather than all your Willpower each day. After sixteen weeks of recovery, you can recover down to Fatigue zero. After another sixteen weeks, your recovery times return to normal. It is very, very difficult for your body to come back from this. Medical attention halves these times.</p> <h6 id="81---100-melted-leg-legs">(81 - 100) Melted Leg (Legs)</h6> <p>Your clothing and leg were both burnt so horridly that it’s hard to tell where one ends and the other begins. Much to your displeasure, you can still feel the limb–or, rather, the mass of agonizing pain where your functional leg used to be. When you move, bits of black flake off–probably best not to think about whether or not that’s you or your outfit. Your movement speed is reduced by 30%, and you take a -6 to all Defensive rolls.</p> <p>This takes thirty weeks to heal on its own (but you really don’t want to do that), but only twelve with medical attention.</p> </d-article> <d-appendix> <d-footnote-list></d-footnote-list> <d-citation-list></d-citation-list> </d-appendix> <d-bibliography src="/assets/bibliography/"></d-bibliography> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 Anchorsify .
