You can take a maximum of two Creation Uniques.</p> <h5 id="analyst">Analyst</h5> <p>You like to study everything you can about people, their actions, their routines, as well as everything around you. This can be distracting at times, but usually it’ll give you a good grasp of the situation and your surroundings.</p> <p>You have a +2 bonus to Awareness rolls, and whenever you take a Rest action you gain 2 AP. Whenever someone uses the same type of attack against you consecutively (Katon into Katon, Weapon Taijutsu into Weapon Taijutsu, etc), you gain 1 AP and get +1 to your defensive roll, up to a maximum of 2 AP and +2 to your defensive roll for being attacked the same way three times in a row. This is tracked separately per attacker.</p> <p>You have a -4 penalty to Athletics rolls, as your observational powers can make you hesitate when you take action.</p> <h5 id="berserker">Berserker</h5> <p>A beast of a ninja you are, and you act like one too! You get angry easily, and often make rash, terrible decisions out of being bull-headed. At least you’re hard to take down when things come to combat (as they often do).</p> <p>You add an extra RESx2 to your Vitality. You can opt to take no defensive action in response to an enemy’s attack, and so long as the attack does not incapacitate you, you can then immediately attack the target as an Interrupt using any Taijutsu attack you know, with the following changes:</p> <ul> <li>The attack has a +3 accuracy bonus and is made at half its normal Speed, and cannot have its Speed reduced further.</li> <li>This attack must be directed at the person who attacked you.</li> <li>Its base Speed cannot be greater than the base Speed of the attack which provoked it.</li> </ul> <p>For every 25% of your maximum Vitality you’re missing, you deal 5% more damage with Taijutsu, to a maximum of 20% more damage (when you have no Vitality). When you are reduced to 0 Vitality, you must immediately choose whether to surrender or to fly into an unyielding rage: If you choose to fight, you won’t stop until all your opponents have been incapacitated (even if they try to surrender peacefully).</p> <p>Because of your rash nature, it is sometimes hard for you to act like a proper shinobi. You have a -5 to all Stealth rolls.</p> <h5 id="chakra-sensor">Chakra Sensor</h5> <p>You possess the coveted ability to sense chakra in living things! With this ability, you can locate people from a distance by sensing their chakra, and can even tell people apart by their chakra alone.</p> <p>Your sense range is CHA yards, within which you can use Chakra Control in place of any Awareness or Espionage roll by paying attention to the presence and fluctuations of people’s chakra. When you detect someone (by using Chakra Control in place of Awareness or Espionage, or the special Scan action, below), you can tell various traits of a person’s chakra (“weak”, “demonic”, etc), their Elemental Affinity, whether or not they have a kekkai genkai (but not what it is), and their current Fatigue level. Once you have detected someone, you can identify their chakra signature in the future (i.e., you could detect that someone Henged is a classmate of yours if sensed previously). If you detect someone who’s in Stealth or Hiding Among Clones, you know their location and can distinguish them between their clones (except for Kage Bunshin), just as if you’d found them normally. Finally, you gain +3 to your maximum ranks in Chakra Control, and can take the following action:</p> <h6 id="scan-speed-8">Scan (Speed 8)</h6> <p>Make a Chakra Control vs Stealth roll of everyone present, with a penalty to the stealth roll equal to the total Upkeep penalty of any jutsu they’re maintaining. If you succeed, you detect them as described above. Out of combat, if someone passes a roll against your Scan action, they will automatically pass all other rolls against it made within the same scene (or in-game hour).</p> <p>Your attunement to Chakra can make it more difficult to handle debilitations, however, and you take a -4 to Resistance rolls.</p> <h5 id="competitive">Competitive</h5> <p>You always want to win every race, hit the bull’s-eye first, and beat everyone in every game you play. In fights, winning is your everything; that can be good, since losing a fight as a ninja may have fatal consequences.</p> <p>You gain 3 bonus XP for every spar or fight you participate in (Events do not count), all your attacks do an extra 5% damage, and you gain a +2 to all d20 rolls.</p> <p>Whenever you miss with an attack, you become increasingly frustrated and driven to land a solid blow on your enemy. This gives you a -1 penalty to all your d20 rolls, but also a +1 bonus to Accuracy, up to a maximum of -5 and +5 respectively (attacks with accuracy rolls use the accuracy bonus, not the d20 roll penalty). These both reset to 0 when you hit someone.</p> <h5 id="defender">Defender</h5> <p>Throwing solid blocks, you’ve honed your reflexes and worked your bones and tendons hard so that your twitch reflex is all you need to keep yourself safe.</p> <p>You gain RES/4 Damage Reduction, and you can use the Block defense as a Speed 4 Interrupt. Anytime you are struck by an unarmed attack, your attacker takes RES/2 damage (which can’t wound)—Punching you hurts. Finally, you treat any damage you take as 10% lower for determining what Wounds you take, which increases to 25% when you Block.</p> <p>The focus on self-preservation, however, has left you more cautious than most even when attacking. The damage of all your attacks is considered 10% lower for determining what wounds they cause.</p> <h5 id="energetic">Energetic</h5> <p>Running, jumping, swimming, fighting; none of it seems to tire you out. Eventually you’ll wear down, but not until long after your friends are left staggering around and panting for breath. On the other hand, it’s hard to sit still and focus, let alone study, when you’re more or less hyperactive.</p> <p>You have 6 levels of Fatigue instead of the usual 5, and suffer Fatigue penalties (-1 Accuracy, -2 defenses, and so on) as if you were one Fatigue category lower, while retaining the regular benefits.</p> <p>However, your lack of focus lowers your maximum rank in all Skills by 2.</p> <h5 id="genius">Genius</h5> <p>The term ‘genius’ has a different meaning to ninja than ordinary people. It’s not a measure of intelligence, but rather how easily one can understand the concepts behind ninja techniques. The smartest shinobi alive might not be called a genius, but a Genin using advanced jutsu certainly would. Ninja are just kind of like that. Your natural talent may allow you to be lazy and smug, or it could motivate you on to further greatness.</p> <p>The cost to learn jutsu is reduced by half, rounded up. Additionally, you can learn jutsu of one rank higher than you would normally be allowed, though the ability to learn higher-ranked jutsu does not allow you to bypass ability or talent requirements for learning jutsu of certain ranks (such as Medical Training, Genjutsu Awareness, or Sealing Jutsu Training).</p> <p>Reaching beyond your grasp has a cost: Any jutsu you couldn’t perform without Genius has its cost(s) increased by 3.</p> <h5 id="juggernaut">Juggernaut</h5> <p>You are a solid, hulking brute. You aren’t necessarily tall, but you condition yourself hard and have always had a natural gift at receiving pain: Thick, solid forearm muscles and tendons, strong shins, you are a rough opponent to face and an even harder one to stop.</p> <p>You use STR/12, rather than STR/15, to calculate your Physical Damage Bonus, you gain STR/4 Damage Reduction, and reduce the severity of any Stun you receive by STR/20.</p> <p>All your movement is reduced by 10%. This applies to your normal movement speed based on AGI, jutsu which allow you to travel (such as Vaulting Leap or Exploding Water Shockwave), and even knockback effects from your enemies.</p> <h5 id="killer">Killer</h5> <p>You were born to do this. As a ninja, you know all about how the body works. It’s a frail bag made of skin, surrounding squishy parts that are easily penetrable. You have either learned the workings of the body, or perhaps you’re just a bit more brutal, disregarding the fact that your opponents are living creatures. Whatever way it works out, you are a natural born killer, though sometimes you get a bit caught up in all of it.</p> <p>Your attacks count as doing 20% more damage for the purposes of wounds, but you may choose to lower the severity of any wounds you inflict by one category. You can make Called Shots at no penalty for all non-area of effect attacks. You start with five ranks in the Toxicology skill, and you may replace the Medicine-based limit of the ability Anatomical Knowledge with any other skill of your choice (making it Athletics/5, or Stealth/5, etc). Alternatively, you can keep it as Medicine, and have its XP cost reduced by half (making it Base 3, Scale 1).</p> <p>Your insidious nature is not without its faults: You take a -1 on all Defensive rolls.</p> <h5 id="large">Large</h5> <p>You are more muscular, taller, wider, or otherwise… bigger, than other people. Perhaps you’re broad-shouldered and muscular but within the realm of plausibility, or maybe you’re a seven foot tall brute; ninja can be downright abnormal. All of your Taijutsu gain (STR/25) extra dice (including basic attacks, and weapons!), to a maximum of double their normal dice, you add STR/8 to Grapple Rolls (instead of the normal STR/10) and your Taijutsu all have +1 range. In addition to hitting hard, you’re tough to take down: you add RES to your maximum Vitality and maximum HP, on top of their normal values. Finally, you have a +2 bonus to Stamina rolls.</p> <p>All attacks that benefit from this unique have their base Speed increased by 2.</p> <p>NOTE: You can not take Small if you take this unique.</p> <h5 id="lucky">Lucky</h5> <p>Most things seem to go your way, be it from natural talent or you just happen to pray to the right luck gods! Finding money on the ground or seeing the footprints of an enemy ninja, it all comes to you naturally, and easily, as if you didn’t have to work for it at all!</p> <p>On any non-combat roll (meaning this can never apply in combat), you roll two dice and keep the highest, rather than just rolling one. Additionally, 2+EXP/750 times per day you can reroll any roll, or allow a (willing) ally to reroll any roll. You can alternatively force an enemy to reroll, which takes two of your rerolls.</p> <p>When you have no rerolls left, you take a -2 penalty to Accuracy and d20 rolls.</p> <h5 id="naturalist">Naturalist</h5> <p>You are at one with nature! Animals like you more, you understand nature like one of them, and your energy is naturally powerful. You also can forage well, notice slight differences in the environment to follow footprints, or even see the handiwork ninja leave with their traps! Perhaps it’s because of your attunement, or that you are tempted by your primal urges, either way you are still a great asset.</p> <p>Your maximum ranks in Survival are increased by 3, and you gain a +3 bonus to detect, disarm, or avoid any part of a trap. Your ninjutsu damage bonus is CHA/12, rather than CHA/15. You have a +1 bonus to your Chakra Control rolls per rank of the jutsu you’re using (+1 for E-rank, +2 for D-rank, etc.), and you lower the Seal Speeds of all Jutsu you use the same amount (-1 for E-rank, -2 for D-rank, etc). Finally, you can use your ranks in the Survival skill in place of the Research skill to meet any Jutsu prerequisites.</p> <p>However, your maximum Research rank is reduced by 3.</p> <h5 id="nimble">Nimble</h5> <p>You are very fast, but more importantly you know how to shift your weight to make it easy to bound walls, scamper up to rooftops, weave through tree branches, and jump kick enemies.</p> <p>You have +1 to Accuracy and Defensive Rolls and the base Speed of all non-Variable, non-Interrupt actions you take is reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 3).</p> <p>On the other hand, when you are caught, it hurts! Damage from attacks is considered 10% higher for determining Wounds.</p> <h5 id="small">Small</h5> <p>You are short, spry, and easily toppled over. The last one’s not so good, but your diminutive frame makes it harder for others to keep track of you, while allowing you to squeeze into tight spaces and narrowly dodge attacks.</p> <p>You have a +2 bonus to Dodge, and your Dodge interrupt’s Speed is changed to 1. If its Speed is somehow raised, you may still always use it. Additionally, the dodge penalty for not being able to reach the edge of an area of-effect technique is halved for you, and capped at -10.</p> <p>On the other hand, your small stature makes you quite frail compared to the ordinary ninja: You apply your RES one less time to your Vitality.</p> <p>Note: You can not take Large if you take this unique.</p> <h5 id="skilled-shinobi">Skilled Shinobi</h5> <p>While you don’t excel in combat, you’re able to grasp the fundamental skills and concepts important to being a ninja.</p> <p>You have an extra XP/75 Skill Points to spend, and your maximum skill rank for all skills is increased by 1.</p> <p>However, you have a -1 Accuracy penalty.</p> <h5 id="specialist">Specialist</h5> <p>You excel in a particular style of ninja combat, and since noticing that strength you have focused on what you are best at. Be it extraordinary kicks, incredible lightning bolts, or masterful illusions, you are a cut above the rest.</p> <p>Choose either Taijutsu, Ninjutsu, or Genjutsu: Whichever one you chose has +2 Accuracy (or in the case of Genjutsu, +3 to your Genjutsu rolls), +2 to its Stamina and/or CE rolls, and a 10% bonus to its damage.</p> <p>Next, choose one of the two that you didn’t pick. It has -1 Accuracy (or -2 to all Genjutsu rolls), -2 to its Stamina and/or CE rolls, and does 10% less damage.</p> <h5 id="strong-willed">Strong-Willed</h5> <p>When the going gets tough, you keep on going. You have a strong, virtually unbreakable will, and can power through anything standing in your way.</p> <p>You reduce the penalty to any Accuracy, Fatigue, or d20 roll you make by 1 per roll (not per penalty: If you had -2 Accuracy from Wounds, -1 Accuracy from Fatigue, and -2 accuracy from a Visibility Penalty, your total penalty is -4, rather than -5). You can ignore the effects of one wound you are suffering from; any time you’re wounded you may continue to ignore the current wound, or change to the newly-inflicted one. Finally, you have +2 to all Genjutsu rolls, and you can spend a point of willpower as a Speed 0 interrupt after you fail a Genjutsu Defense to immediately end the Genjutsu you were affected by, so long as you managed to recognize that a Genjutsu was used on you.</p> <h5 id="warder">Warder</h5> <p>You’ve trained hard to become adept at brushing aside incoming objects that are liable to hurt you! This is useful for shinobi-related activities such as not dying.</p> <p>Your Parry action becomes a Speed 2 Interrupt, and has a +2 bonus. Jutsu-based defenses reliant upon an Accuracy Roll gain a +2 to their Accuracy Roll and -2 to their Base Speed, to a minimum of 1. Additionally, you can parry weapons with your bare hands (catching the blade, striking an opponent’s arm to knock their blow aside, and so on), or unarmed attacks with a weapon.</p> <p>Your reliance on standing your ground while responding to attacks, however, results in a -2 dodge penalty.</p> </d-article> <d-appendix> <d-footnote-list></d-footnote-list> <d-citation-list></d-citation-list> </d-appendix> <d-bibliography src="/assets/bibliography/"></d-bibliography> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 Anchorsify .
