Even so, a wise ninja, magical or not, will equip themselves with a wide variety of tools. True, you could create a thick bank of fog instead of throwing down a smoke bomb–but that smoke bomb’s faster, and less taxing.</p> <p>Every piece of equipment has a cost in Ryo, the world’s most commonly-used currency. You can get Ryo in two primary ways, the Money: Requisition and Money: Savings abilities.</p> <p>Items bought with Requisition can be traded in and replaced whenever you visit your village. Items bought with Savings are yours forever, for better or worse; if you lose them, they won’t be replaced.</p> <p>Items can be divided into two broad categories: Consumable and non-consumable. Consumable items are gone once you use them. These are things like smoke bombs, poisons, and explosives. Used-up consumables can be restocked when you get back to your village, if they were bought with Requisition. It is generally unwise to purchase consumables with Savings; if you do, once you use them they are gone forever. Non-consumable items can be broken, destroyed, or lost, but usually aren’t. These are things like ropes, weapons, and lockpicks. Ranged weapons are not destroyed on use (hit or miss).</p> <p>== Equipment weight == In some cases, equipment weight will come up. Weights are listed below.</p> <ul> <li>Large Gourd: 66 lb (Full)</li> <li>Small Gourd: 16 lb (Full)</li> <li>Any melee weapon: 5 lb</li> <li>Any large ranged weapon: 3 lb</li> <li>Any other ranged weapon: Trivial</li> <li>Poisons: Trivial</li> <li>Basic equipment/supplies/unlisted: Trivial</li> </ul> <p>== Weapon-Specific Actions == Draw Weapon (Speed 3) Weapons are typically carried attached to one’s person somehow; swords have sheathes, a pair of tonfa might be tucked through belt holsters, a fan could be strapped across your back, and so forth. Drawing a weapon is retrieving it from wherever you have it stored and placing it in your hands. At this point you can use it to attack, parry, or whatever else you please, with the downside being that your hands aren’t free for, say, handseals. You may also draw a weapon at the start of combat (when you roll initiative), without taking an action to do so. If you wish, you can draw two weapons as a single Speed 5 action. Note that you only need to Draw weapons you intend to hold and use in melee. This Speed to attack with thrown or multi-thrown weapons includes the time needed to retrieve them from holsters. The same is true for Bows.</p> <p>Be aware: While holding one or more weapons, you can still make basic unarmed attacks. You cannot, however, use Unarmed or Combo jutsu. Grappling is still possible as long as you have at least one hand free.</p> <p>Sheathe Weapon (Speed 6) You put a weapon you’re holding away, in some secure fashion. If you’re holding two weapons, you can put them both away at the same time.</p> <p>Discard Weapon (Speed 1, or Speed +2) You drop or toss aside a weapon. Done normally, this is a Speed 1 action. However, it may also be used alongside an Interrupt (such as a defensive ninjutsu technique) by increasing that action’s Speed (after AP reductions) by 2.</p> <p>Retrieve Weapon (Speed 5) You pick up a weapon on the ground. This can be your weapon, or someone else’s, as long as nobody’s currently holding it. You can only pick up one melee weapon at a time with this action, and must be able to physically reach it (which may require you to move first). You can also pick up DEX/10 used throwing weapons and holster them appropriately.</p> <p>Disarm (Weapon’s Speed +4) You use a weapon you’re holding to knock an enemy’s out of their grasp, usually by hitting it at such an angle, and with enough force, that it becomes physically impossible for them to hold onto it. This is a basic weapon attack that does no damage, but if it hits you knock their weapon STR/10 yards in any direction (if straight up, the weapon lands at their feet but cannot be retrieved for STR/10 IC). Trying to Parry a Disarm attempt has a -3 penalty. Small weapons cannot disarm Large weapons, and Large weapons lack the finesse to be used to disarm at all.</p> <h2 id="melee-weapons">Melee Weapons</h2> <p>Next to a weapon’s name are various characteristics of the weapon, useful for determining what kind of wounds it inflicts and what jutsu it may be used with. Of particular note is the “Two-Handed” descriptor, meaning the weapon in question may only be used by holding it in both hands. When being used two-handed, the weapon increases its user’s Damage Bonus by 25%. This multiplication only applies to the STR/15 (or similar stat-derived divisor, if it’s somehow changed), and does not apply to abilities or jutsu which add to or subtract from your damage bonus.</p> <h5 id="blunt-weapons">Blunt Weapons</h5> <h6 id="bo-staff-blunt-polearm-two-handed">Bo Staff (Blunt, Polearm, Two-Handed)</h6> <p>A weapon which sees more use in martial arts than among ninja, the bo staff is traditionally six feet long, though ninja scale their staves to their users. The bo is, essentially, a hard wooden pole, sometimes tapered at the ends.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 100 Ryo</li> <li>Stamina: 15</li> <li>Damage: 6d10</li> <li>Accuracy: +1</li> <li>Speed: 14</li> <li>Special: Attacks from a Bo Staff do not trigger effects dependent upon being in melee with an enemy (such as most damage-on-hit effects), and you can parry unarmed attacks with a Bo Staff with a -2 penalty. You can add the “Dual” tag for a Bo Staff when attacking, losing its Two-Handed tag and Accuracy bonus to do so, along with its ability to avoid effects dependent upon being in melee.</li> </ul> <h6 id="gunbai-large-blunt-fan-two-handed">Gunbai (Large, Blunt, Fan, Two-Handed)</h6> <p>Large fans with reinforced wooden slats, these were originally used by generals to signal soldiers on battlefields. Then some ninja was looking for a way to be unique, got ahold of the idea, and, well… the usual. Though they’re several feet long, these fans do (impressively) fold.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 200 Ryo</li> <li>Stamina: 12</li> <li>Damage: 8d12</li> <li>Accuracy: -2</li> <li>Speed: 12</li> <li>Special: You may Block as a Speed 5 Interrupt with a Gunbai. Blocking weapons with a Gunbai reduces their damage by 50%, rather than 25%.</li> </ul> <h6 id="kusari-gama-blunt-chain">Kusari-gama (Blunt, Chain)</h6> <p>A weapon that consists of an adapted kama on a narrow metal chain with a heav, typically iron, weight on one end. Some shinobi have been known to replace the kama with a heavy metal spike.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 125 Ryo</li> <li>Stamina: 12</li> <li>Damage: 8d10</li> <li>Range: 5</li> <li>Speed: 12</li> <li>Special: The stats above are for the weighted ball end, which is attached via chain to a Kama (which uses the standard Kama statistics). Using this weapon takes both hands, but does not grant the normal Two-Handed bonus (or the tag). The weighted end can be used to perform Disarm or Grab (the E-Rank Grapple jutsu) with its normal range, and grants a +3 to Grapple rolls. Grappling someone with this weapon does not impose a penalty on your own Dodge or Parry interrupts, though the ball end of the weapon can not be used for anything else while a grapple is maintained, and Ignite statuses do not transfer between grapplers. In addition, the person you’re grappling can not move more than 5 yards away from you: if they would do something that would move them further, you are moved as well (and vice-versa), though normal rules for trying to move while in a grapple apply. You can always elect to end the grapple by simply discarding the weapon (see the Discard weapon action). Once someone is grappled with this weapon, you can perform any Grapple jutsu of C or lower rank on them, with the exception of Headbutt, Suplex, and Pressure Point. The weapon is considered to have unlimited limbs.</li> </ul> <h6 id="nunchaku-blunt">Nunchaku (Blunt)</h6> <p>A pair of wooden handles attached by a length of rope or chain, a single nunchaku is generally wielded by grabbing one handle and using it to spin the other and bludgeon someone. Paired they do the same thing, except twice as much.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 80 Ryo</li> <li>Stamina: 8</li> <li>Damage: 5d8</li> <li>Accuracy: +1</li> <li>Speed: 10</li> <li>Special: Consecutive basic attacks with Nunchaku with no other non-interrupt actions between them lowers its Speed by 1 and increases your Damage Bonus by 0.5, to a maximum of -4 and +2. The Speed reduction acts in all ways as if you’d spent AP to do so (and follows its normal limits). You can add the “Dual” tag to any attack you make with a Nunchaku, but you lose its Accuracy bonus for that attack.</li> </ul> <h6 id="sai-blunt-dual">Sai (Blunt, Dual)</h6> <p>A martial arts weapon, the sai consists of a single main, dagger-like spike, with two prongs extending from the handle. The points of this weapon are blunted, and the prongs reinforced; it’s a primarily defensive weapon.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 75 Ryo</li> <li>Stamina: 8</li> <li>Damage: 4d8</li> <li>Accuracy: +1</li> <li>Speed: 9</li> <li>Special: +2 Parry. If you successfully parry any weapon with your sai, you may elect to perform the Disarm action as an Interrupt against your opponent as a Stamina 12 action, using your parry roll as your attack roll for the disarm. If you successfully Disarm your opponent in this way, you can elect to catch their weapon in your other hand rather than send it flying, so long as you aren’t holding anything in it already.</li> </ul> <h6 id="tetsubo-large-blunt-polearm-two-handed">Tetsubo (Large, Blunt, Polearm, Two-Handed)</h6> <p>Rarely used among ninja, except ones who want to demonstrate how overpoweringly strong they are, the tetsubo is a large wooden pole, often with iron studs on the business end.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 250 Ryo</li> <li>Stamina: 18</li> <li>Damage: 12d12</li> <li>Accuracy: -3</li> <li>Speed: 16, Delay 8</li> <li>Special: Stun 6. Attacks from a Tetsubo do not trigger effects dependent upon being in melee with an enemy (such as most damage-on-hit effects). Anyone attempting to parry this weapon takes a -3 to their parry roll, and this weapon reduces blocking by an additional 25% (which means, normally, that blocking does not reduce its damage at all).</li> </ul> <h6 id="tonfa-blunt-dual">Tonfa (Blunt, Dual)</h6> <p>Originating from a small island off the shore of fire country, the tonfa began as a martial arts implement, which ninja have seen fit to ‘borrow’ and upgrade. A single tonfa is essentially a wooden bar the length of the wielder’s forearm with a handle 1/4 of the way from one end. Typically wielded in pairs, they’re an unorthodox but sometimes-effective weapon.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 50 Ryo</li> <li>Stamina: 10</li> <li>Damage: 4d8</li> <li>Accuracy: +1</li> <li>Speed: 10</li> <li>Special: You can parry unarmed attacks with a Tonfa, and blocks with Tonfa against other weapons reduces their damage by 50% (rather than the normal 25%).</li> </ul> <h6 id="umbrella-blunt">Umbrella (Blunt)</h6> <p>Yes, umbrellas. Ones used in combat are reinforced with metal or hard wood, making them semi-decent bludgeoning weapons, and most have a sharp, pointed tip added at the end.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 100 Ryo</li> <li>Stamina: 11</li> <li>Damage: 6d10</li> <li>Speed: 12</li> <li>Special: You may Block as a Speed 6 Interrupt with an Umbrella. Blocking weapons with an Umbrella reduces their damage by 50%, rather than 25%.</li> </ul> <h4 id="piercing-weapons">Piercing Weapons</h4> <h6 id="kama-piercing-dual">Kama (Piercing, Dual)</h6> <p>Farming tools used by the ninja of old, back before they had awesome chakra-powered pyrotechnics. A kama is pretty much a short wooden handle with a slightly-curved blade at a right angle to it on one end.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 25 Ryo</li> <li>Stamina: 10</li> <li>Damage: 3d8</li> <li>Accuracy: +2</li> <li>Speed: 11</li> </ul> <h6 id="ninja-to-piercing-sword">Ninja-to (Piercing, Sword)</h6> <p>A small, light-weight straight-bladed sword with a traditionally square-shaped handguard, the ninja-to is, as its name may suggest, favored by shinobi.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 100 Ryo</li> <li>Stamina: 9</li> <li>Damage: 7d10</li> <li>Speed: 9</li> <li>Special: Drawing and Sheathing a ninja-to is a Speed 2 action, both of which can be reduced by Quick Draw. Drawing and Sheathing a Ninja-to can also be done alongside an interrupt, increasing the speed of that Interrupt by 2 (which is also reduced by Quick Draw).</li> </ul> <h6 id="tanto-small-piercing-sword">Tanto (Small, Piercing, Sword)</h6> <p>A straight-bladed dagger, usually double-edged, between six and twelve inches long. Good for stabbing people! Popular among reasonably wealthy civilians for purposes of self defense.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 150 Ryo</li> <li>Stamina: 8</li> <li>Accuracy: +2</li> <li>Damage: 5d6</li> <li>Speed: 8</li> <li>Special: Ignores armor.</li> </ul> <h6 id="yari-large-piercing-polearm-two-handed">Yari (Large, Piercing, Polearm, Two-Handed</h6> <p>An infantry weapon among mundane armies, the Yari is about as simple as a polearm can get: wooden pole, straight wooden blade with a sharp point that you stick into other people.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 125 Ryo</li> <li>Stamina: 14</li> <li>Damage: 8d12</li> <li>Accuracy: -1</li> <li>Speed: 14</li> <li>Special: This weapon’s damage is considered 20% higher for the purpose of inflicting wounds. Attacks from a Yari do not trigger effects dependent upon being in melee with an enemy (such as most damage-on-hit effects).</li> </ul> <h5 id="slashing-weapons">Slashing Weapons</h5> <h6 id="katana-slashing-sword">Katana (Slashing, Sword)</h6> <p>The traditional samurai sword, with a slightly curved blade and wavy design along the edge due to its forging.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 250 Ryo</li> <li>Stamina: 12</li> <li>Damage: 10d10</li> <li>Speed: 13</li> <li>Special: By taking a -1 to Accuracy, you can add the “Dual” tag to a Katana you use it with a Wakizashi to attack.</li> </ul> <h6 id="naginata-large-slashing-polearm-two-handed">Naginata (Large, Slashing, Polearm, Two-Handed)</h6> <p>A weapon almost as traditional as the katana, and even more rarely appropriated for use by ninja, the naginata is essentially a wooden pole with a sword-like curved blade on the end.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 150 Ryo</li> <li>Stamina: 16</li> <li>Damage: 6d12</li> <li>Speed: 14</li> <li>Special: Attacks from a Naginata do not trigger effects dependent upon being in melee with an enemy (such as most damage-on-hit effects).</li> </ul> <h6 id="nodachi-large-slashing-sword-two-handed">Nodachi (Large, Slashing, Sword, Two-Handed)</h6> <p>A massive curved sword, it is functionally a two-handed version of a katana made longer in both handle and blade. It is a weapon made to test the limits of practical weapon sizes, which means every blacksmith makes their nodachi differently.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 200 Ryo</li> <li>Stamina: 14</li> <li>Damage: 11d12</li> <li>Accuracy: -1</li> <li>Speed: 15</li> <li>Special: Anyone attempting to parry a Nodachi has a -4 penalty; however, when attempting to parry using a Nodachi, your parry roll suffers a -1 penalty.</li> </ul> <h6 id="tessen-small-slashing-fan-dual">Tessen (Small, Slashing, Fan, Dual)</h6> <p>A small war fan, used, much like their larger counterparts, to signal troops in combat. Or, if you’re a ninja, to kill people with. The tessen, as used by ninja, is a handheld folding or non-folding fan with, at the very least, a sharpened metal edge.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 60 Ryo</li> <li>Stamina: 10</li> <li>Damage: 6d6</li> <li>Accuracy: +1</li> <li>Speed: 8</li> <li>Special: Tessen may be used to parry unarmed attacks.</li> </ul> <h6 id="trench-knives-small-slashing-dual">Trench Knives (Small, Slashing, Dual)</h6> <p>Essentially knuckle dusters with the blunt or knobbed front replaced by a serrated blade which extends several inches past the end of the fingers. They are most often used as a pair.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 40 Ryo</li> <li>Stamina: 10</li> <li>Damage: 6d6</li> <li>Speed: 9</li> <li>Special: +1 Accuracy when using two of them to attack as a dual-wield attack. You may perform handseals while holding trench knives, increasing the Seal Speed by 3 (whether you’re wielding one or two of them).</li> </ul> <h6 id="wakizashi-small-slashing-sword">Wakizashi (Small, Slashing, Sword)</h6> <p>Among samurai, this is the traditional partner of the katana. The wakizashi has a blade about a foot and a half long. It’s a relatively small sword, which makes it easier for follow-up attacks in concert with its heavier partner.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 125 Ryo</li> <li>Stamina: 8</li> <li>Damage: 8d6</li> <li>Accuracy: +1</li> <li>Speed: 9</li> <li>Special: By taking a -1 to Accuracy, you can add the “Dual” tag to a Wakizashi if you use it with a Katana to attack.</li> </ul> <h6 id="zanbato-large-slashing-sword-two-handed">Zanbato (Large, Slashing, Sword, Two-Handed)</h6> <p>Zanbato were created as a result of the nodachi’s historied lack of specificity; at some point blacksmiths began to compete with one another to see who could create the most oversized sword. The result is the Zanbato, which border on impossible to utilize effectively, though where there is a will..</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 400 Ryo</li> <li>Stamina: 20</li> <li>Damage: 15d12</li> <li>Accuracy: -4</li> <li>Speed: 18</li> <li>Special: A Zanbato’s base parry speed is increased by 2. This weapon can not be wielded with one hand under any circumstances (i.e., Monkey Grip does not apply to this weapon).</li> <li>Requires: 100 STR to wield.</li> </ul> <h2 id="ranged-weapons">Ranged Weapons</h2> <h4 id="small-thrown">Small Thrown</h4> <h5 id="kunai-small-piercing-thrown">Kunai (Small, Piercing, Thrown)</h5> <p>One of the two mainstays of ninja armed combat, the kunai is a small metal knife, shaped like an elongated diamond. On the short end it has a handle just long enough to wrap one’s hand around, typically wrapped in cloth to improve the grip, and a metal ring on the end of that.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 10 Ryo</li> <li>Stamina: 5</li> <li>Damage: 2d6</li> <li>Range: 5 + STR/4</li> <li>Speed: 6</li> <li>Special: Kunai may be used as a melee weapon, in which case they gain the Dual tag and +1 Accuracy, with an additional +1 to Parry.</li> </ul> <h5 id="shuriken-small-slashing-thrown">Shuriken (Small, Slashing, Thrown)</h5> <p>The other classic ninja weapon, even more famous than the kunai, shuriken are small, flat four-pointed metal stars thrown at opponents to distract and mildly injure them. Like kunai, shuriken are black, making them less reflective and generally harder to spot in low-light conditions.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 5 Ryo</li> <li>Stamina: 5</li> <li>Damage: 1d6</li> <li>Accuracy: +2</li> <li>Range: 5 + STR/4</li> <li>Speed: 5</li> </ul> <h5 id="senbon-small-piercing-thrown">Senbon (Small, Piercing, Thrown)</h5> <p>Large metal needles, traditionally used in acupuncture. Rarely, particularly skilled shinobi will use these with devastating efficiency. Frequently, particularly overconfident shinobi will use this with depressing ineptitude.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 10</li> <li>Stamina: 5</li> <li>Damage: 1d4</li> <li>Accuracy: -2</li> <li>Range: 5 + STR/5</li> <li>Speed: 7</li> <li>Special: Ignores armor and half of an opponent’s DR.</li> </ul> <h5 id="large-thrown">Large Thrown</h5> <p>Fuuma Shuriken (Large, Slashing, Thrown)</p> <p>A fairly complex device, a fuuma shuriken is four curved blades that can fold together and be used as an improvised blade in melee combat, or unfolded and locked open, taking on a pinwheel shape, to be thrown.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 100 Ryo</li> <li>Stamina: 15</li> <li>Damage: (4+STR/12)d12</li> <li>Range: STR/3</li> <li>Speed: 14</li> <li>Special: For every point you hit by, you add 10% to the attack’s total damage, to a maximum of +150% (so, if they dodged and you hit by 3 points you’d do 1.3 times damage, and that number would be reduced by the effects of partial success); if it is blocked, it simply gets +25% to its damage, instead. HP-based defenses which do not require a roll are considered to have a roll of 10. You may also use the Fuuma Shuriken as a melee weapon, in which case it loses all of its other special effects and deals only 6d12 damage.</li> </ul> <h5 id="large-star-shuriken-large-piercing-thrown">Large Star Shuriken (Large, Piercing, Thrown)</h5> <p>The name is about as literal as it could be: it’s essentially a shuriken many, many times larger than a normal shuriken, up to four feet from the tip of one point to the opposite. It generally sees limited use in combat due to its cumbersome size.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 100 Ryo</li> <li>Stamina: 18</li> <li>Damage: (6+STR/12)d12</li> <li>Range: STR/3</li> <li>Speed: 14</li> <li>Special: For every point you hit by, you add 10% to the attack’s total damage, to a maximum of +200%; if it is blocked, it simply gets +25% to its damage, instead. HP-based defenses which do not require a roll are considered to have a roll of 10. This weapon’s damage is considered 25% higher for the purpose of inflicting wounds. Because these are large and encumbering, they are typically worn somehow strapped to the back; for each large star shuriken beyond the first you are carrying you take a -1 Immobilization penalty which does not fade over time like normal, though reducing the number of Large Star Shuriken you carry will lower it.</li> </ul> <h4 id="exotic">Exotic</h4> <h5 id="bow-daikyu">Bow, Daikyu</h5> <p>A large bow, generally bigger than its wielder at six feet or so high. The upper ‘half’ is actually 2/3 or so of the total length. As most ninja find these near-useless in combat, they tend to see more use in assassination missions.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 250 Ryo</li> <li>Stamina: 20</li> <li>Damage: (STR/8) dice; die size determined by arrow</li> <li>Accuracy: -10</li> <li>Range: STR</li> <li>Speed: 20</li> <li>Special: The bow uses double your damage bonus. Using a bow always takes two hands. You may take a Speed 10 Aim action which gives the attack +4 Accuracy. You may Aim up to twice for a single attack. If you have to take any action which requires movement (including dodging), you lose the benefits of your aim.</li> </ul> <h5 id="bow-yumi">Bow, Yumi</h5> <p>Technically, it’s called a hankyu, and kyudo practitioners would be horridly offended to hear shinobi calling all bows of this sort ‘yumis’. However, ninja hardly care! The yumi is a much smaller bow, typically not more than four feet long.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 150 Ryo</li> <li>Stamina: 15</li> <li>Damage: (STR/10) dice; die size determined by arrow</li> <li>Range: STR /2</li> <li>Speed: 14</li> <li>Accuracy: -6</li> <li>Special: You gain +25% to your damage bonus. Using a bow always takes two hands. You may use a Speed 8 Aim action which gives the attack +4 Accuracy. You may Aim up to twice for a single attack. You may dodge while Aiming, though this increases the Speed of your Dodge action by 3.</li> </ul> <h5 id="arrow-piercing">Arrow (Piercing)</h5> <p>These are necessary to use a bow in combat! Specifically, arrows are the ammunition for bows, and each attack you make with a bow requires you to use an arrow. Arrows can usually be retrieved after battle. Arrows are expensive not because of their construction, but because ones of the quality that chakra-using ninja need are hard to come by; shuriken and kunai are competitively mass produced, arrows are not.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 50 Ryo</li> <li>Damage: d12</li> </ul> <h5 id="arrow-armor-piercing-piercing">Arrow, Armor Piercing (Piercing)</h5> <p>Arrows with narrow steel tips that excel in penetrating armor and the like. These ignore the effects of enemy armor when dealing damage, but lose something in terms of killing power due to creating smaller wounds.</p> <ul> <li>Cost: 50</li> <li>Damage: d8</li> </ul> </d-article> <d-appendix> <d-footnote-list></d-footnote-list> <d-citation-list></d-citation-list> </d-appendix> <d-bibliography src="/assets/bibliography/"></d-bibliography> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 Anchorsify .
